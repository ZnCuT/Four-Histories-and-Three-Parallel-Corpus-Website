He strictly corrected criminal and corrupt acts, leaving no delay in enforcement. In a year, the cases he handled numbered only several dozen. His power and authority were stronger than Wang Huan’s, but his literary and administrative skills were inferior. Ren Jun, style name Shugao, died while serving as Governor of Taishan.</td>
