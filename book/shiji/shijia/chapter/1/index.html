                <td class="chinese-cell col-baihua" data-lang="baihua">太史公说：《诗经》里说过：“高山哪，让人仰望。大路啊，让人奔驰。”即使我达不到那样的境界，但我总向往着那个伟大的目标。每当我一读孔子的书时，心里总是想象着他的为人。我曾经到过鲁国，我参观过孔子庙里陈列着的那些车子、衣帽、礼器等，那里的儒生们都按时到孔子的故居去演习礼仪。我见了那种场面也不由得为之流连徘徊，久久地舍不得离去。自古以来出色的君主贤人也很多了，但他们大多数都是活着的时候非常显赫，而死了以后也就悄无声息了。唯有孔子，活着的时候是一个平民百姓，死去已经十几代了，而学者们至今把他奉为祖师爷。现在上起天子王侯，所有中国讲“六经”的人都把孔子的言论作为衡量一切的标准，真可以算得上是至高无上的圣人了!</td>

Well is he called the Supreme Sage!sss</td>
