His family originated in Huaili but later moved to Chengjiang the men of each generation were trained in archery. In the fourteenth year of Emperor Wen,a strong force of Huns rode through the Xiao Pass. Then Li Guang, as the son of a good family, joined the army to resist the enemy. A brilliant mounted archer, he killed and captured many Huns and was made a palace guard. He and his cousin Li Cai, another palace guard, served as mounted guards with a stipend of eight hundred piculs of grain. LiGuang often accompanied the emperor on his trips, and his skill in attack and defence or in grappling with wild beasts made Emperor Wen remark, “What a pity you weren't born at a different time! Had you lived during Emperor Gaozu's reign, you would easily have won a fief with ten thousand households.”</td>

                <td class="chinese-cell col-baihua" data-lang="baihua">等到景帝即位后，李广先任陇西都尉，接着被召进京城做了皇帝的侍从武官——骑郎将。后来吴楚七国叛乱时，李广以骁骑将军的身份跟着太尉周亚夫前往讨伐叛军。在战斗中，李广夺得了敌军的战旗，在昌邑大显威名。只因为梁孝王赠给了李广一颗将军印，回京后被景帝所迁怒，因而在别人受赏时，李广就没能再受到封赏。后来李广被调任上谷太守，匈奴军队每天和他打仗。于是典属国公孙昆邪流着眼泪向景帝请求说：“李广的本领，在当今天下无双，也正因此他自恃武艺高强，天天和敌军交战，我真怕万一有个闪失，损失了这员名将。”于是景帝就把李广调到了上郡当太守。后来，李广历任边地各郡太守，然后调任上郡太守。他曾经做过陇西、 北地、雁门、代郡和云中太守，都因为努力作战而出名。</td>
                <td class="english-cell col-english" data-lang="english">When Emperor Jing ascended the throne, LiGuang was appointed as commander of Longxi and soon promoted to the rank of a general of the mounted guard. During the campaign against Wu and Chu he served as commander of the Valiant Cavalry under Grand Marshal Zhou Yafu and distinguished himself by capturing the rebels' flag at Changyi. But because he accepted an appointment as a general from the prince of Liang without imperial sanction, he was not rewarded on the return of the army. Instead he was made the governor of Shanggu, a district constantly harried by the Huns. The director of dependent states, Gongsun Kunxie, pleaded with the emperor, "There is no braver or more brilliant officer in the empire than Li Guang, but trusting to his own ability he never loses a chance of engaging the Huns. I am afraid we may lose him." Li Guang was therefore transferred to the governorship of Shangjun. He was later transferred to govern various frontier provinces and then made the governor of Shangjun again. He also held posts atLongxi, Beidi, Yanmen, Daijun and Yunzhong. And wherever he went he won fame for his hard fighting.</td>

                <td class="chinese-cell col-baihua" data-lang="baihua">李广做上郡太守的时候，正赶上匈奴人大举进攻上郡，这时皇帝派了一名受宠信的宦官到上郡来跟着李广学习军事。有一次这个宦官带领着几十名骑兵在田野上纵马奔驰，突然遇到了三个匈奴人，便打了起来。结果这个宦官被匈奴人射伤，他带的几十名骑兵几乎全被匈奴人射死了。宦官逃回了李广这里，李广说：“这一定是射雕的。”他立即带了百数名骑兵去追赶这三个人。这三个人把自己的马丢了，只好步行，这时已经走出几十里了。李广命令部下做出了从左右两侧包抄的态势，自己拿了弓箭射他们，结果射死了两个，活捉了一个，一审问，果然是匈奴的射雕人。他们刚把俘虏绑在马上，准备回营，突然望见从远处来了几千名匈奴骑兵。这些骑兵也发现了李广，他们以为这是汉军派出来特意引着他们去上当的，心里很吃惊，于是慌忙冲上山头布好阵式。李广的这百数人怕极了，都想赶紧往回跑。李广说：“这里离着我们的大部队有几十里，我们这百数人如果往回跑，匈奴人迫上来一阵乱箭就都把我们射死了。如果我们留下来不走，匈奴人必然以为我们是大部队派出来故意引诱他们去上当的，他们一定不敢打我们。”于是李广命令这百数人：“前进!”一直走到离匈奴人只有二里地的地方才停下来，接着又下令说：“全体下马，把鞍子解下来!”有人说：“敌人这么多，离我们又这么近，我们再都下马解鞍，如果敌人进攻我们，我们怎么办?”李广说：“敌人肯定以为我们是会跑的，现在我们偏要给他来个下马解鞍表明不跑，以此来强化他们那种错误判断。”这样一来，匈奴人果然没敢进攻李广。后来敌人那边有个骑白马的将领出来整理阵容，这时李广突然上马带着十来个人飞奔过去将他射死了，然后又退了回来解下马鞍子，并命令士兵们把马放开，躺在地上休息。这时天色渐晚，匈奴人始终觉得这伙人可疑，没敢轻易出击。到了半夜，匈奴人更怀疑附近可能埋伏着大批汉军，打算乘夜晚偷袭他们，于是他们赶紧撤走了。第二天清晨，李广才回到大本营。李广的大部队因为不知道李广昨晚去了何处，所以只有在原地待命。</td>
                <td class="english-cell col-english" data-lang="english">When the Huns invaded Shangjun in force, EmperorJing ordered one of his favourite eunuchs to join Li Guang in order to gain experience in fighting the Huns. One day this eunuch at the head of several dozen horsemen met with three Hunnish riders and engaged them in a fight. The Huns turned in their saddles and drew their bows, wounding the eunuch and killing most of his men. The eunuch fled back to Li Guang. “These must be their best sharp-shooters known as the ‘eagle- hunters said Li Guang, and rode out with a hundred horsemen in pursuit. The three Huns had lost their horses and covered several dozen lion foot. Li Guang ordered his men to fan out to the left and the right while he shot at the enemy and, after killing two of them and taking the third alive, he found that these were indeed “eagle-hunters”. Li Guang had barely bound the captive on his horse when several thousand Hunnish horsemen came in sight, but the smallness of the Chinese force made them suspect a trap and they took to the hills in defensive formation. The hundred horsemen with Li Guang were so alarmed that they wanted to gallop straight back. "We are dozens of li from our main force," said Li Guang. "If the hundred of us make a dash for it, the Huns will give chase and shoot us down in no time; whereas if we stay here and will not dare to attack.” He gave the order, “Advance!” When they were about two li from the enemy, he halted and ordered, "Dismount and undo your saddles." "This horde of Huns is almost on top of us," protested his men. “What shall we do if they attack?” "They expect us to withdraw," replied Li Guang."But when they see us unsaddle our horses to stop here, they will be surer than ever that this is a trick." The Huns dared not attack, but one of their chieftains galloped out on a white horse to reconnoitre. Li Guang remounted and charged with a dozen riders to shoot down the Hun. This done, he returned to his troops, unsaddled his mount and ordered his men to turn loose their horses and lie down to sleep. It was now dusk and the Huns were too bewildered to attack. Suspecting that an ambushing Han (206BC.-8A.D.)force might fall on them in the dark, they withdrew by night. At dawn Li Guang rejoined the main army, which had not come to his rescue because it had no idea where he had gone.</td>

                <td class="english-cell col-english" data-lang="english">When Emperor Jing died and Emperor Wu succeeded to the throne,Li Guang's fame as a general won him promotion from his post at Shangjun to the command of the guard of Weiyang Palace. At this time Cheng Bushi was commander of the guard of Changle Palace. He, like Li Guang, had served as a governor of frontier provinces, defending the border and leading expeditions against the Huns. Li Guang paid little attention to military formation on the march, but would make camp wherever he found water and grass and let his men do as they pleased. He appointed no one to sound the watch and kept dispatch-writing and clerical work down to a minimum at his headquarters. But his scouts always reconnoitred deep into enemy territory, and he had never come to any harm. Cheng Bushi, on the other hand, laid great stress on military formation and discipline. Sentries sounded the watch in his camp,and his officers had to sit up all night writing records and reports. But he had never come to grief either. "Li Guang's army routine is certainly simple," said Cheng Bushi once. “But if the enemy launches a sudden attack, he will be at their mercy. Still, his troops have such an easy time of it that they would gladly die for him. Our army routine may be irksome, but the enemy will never catch us napping.” Although both these men were famous generals of the frontier provinces, the Huns feared Li Guang's tactics and soldiers preferred to serve under him rather than under Cheng, who had a reputation for harshness. During Emperor Jing's time, Cheng Bushi had been made a grand counsellor because of the frank advice he gave on several occasions. He was scrupulously honest and a stickler for regulations and discipline.</td>

Li Guang was appointed as General of the Valiant Cavalry un- der the command of Han Anguo, General of the Protecting Army. But the Hunnish khan discovered the trap and withdrew so that the Han troops had no chance to distinguish themselves. Four years later Li Guang, then still a captain of the palace guard, was made a general and sent to attack the Huns beyond Yanmen. His army was outnumbered and routed but he was captured, for the khan, who had heard of his ability, had given orders that he must be taken alive. When the Hunnish cavalry caught him he was wounded, so they laid him on a litter between two horses. They had covered more than ten li when Li Guang, who had shammed dead, saw through half- closed eyelids that a young Hun mounted on a fine horse was beside him. He leapt suddenly on to this horse, throwing down its young rider and snatching away his bow. Then he galloped south for several dozen li until he found what was left of his troops and led them back inside the frontier. Several hundred Hunnish horsemen had galloped after him, but shooting with the Hun's bow as he rode he killed many of his pursuers and made good his escape. Upon his return to the capital, he was tried. As he had lost many men and let himself be captured alive by the Huns, he was sentenced to death; but he was permitted to ransom himself and become a commoner.</td>

Once when out hunting, LiGuang shot a boulder in the grass which he mistook for a tiger, and the entire tip of his arrow was embedded in the rock. But when he realized what it was and shot again, he could not pierce the boulder. Whenever he heard of a tiger in the province where he was living, he would hunt it. In Youbeiping a tiger leapt at him and mauled him, but he finally succeeded in killing the beast.</td>

For over forty years his stipend was two thousand piculs a year, but he saved no money and never talked about property.He was tall and long-armed like an ape. His skill in archery can only be attributed to natural aptitude, for none of his descendants or others who learned bowmanship from him could equal him. He was a poor talker who had little to say. To pass the time with others he would draw military formations on the ground and compete in shooting at them: the losers had to drink. Indeed, up to the end of his life shooting was his sole recreation. When Li Guang's troops were short of water and food, he would not drink until all his men had drunk, nor eat until they had eaten. And since he was lenient and generous to his troops, they served him loyally. In battle, he would not shoot until his adversary was within a few dozen paces and he could be sure of hitting him. Then as soon as his bowstring twanged the enemy fell. Because of this, he and his men were often worsted, just as he was often wounded by beasts in the chase.</td>

                <td class="english-cell col-english" data-lang="english">When Shi Jian the captain of the palace guard died, the emperor appointed Li Guang in his place. In the sixth year of Yuanshuo he served again as rear general under Grand Marshal Wei Qing, advancing from Dingxiang to attack the Huns. Most of the other generals killed and captured enough foes to be made marquises for their services,but Li Guang's army met with no success. Three years later Li Guang, still captain of the palace guard, advanced at the head of four thousand horsemen from Youbeiping, while Zhang Qian, the marquis of Bowang, led ten thousand cavalry by a different route. Li Guang had advanced several hundred li when he was surrounded by the Eastern Prince of the Huns with forty thou- sand horsemen. Seeing that his men were afraid, Li Guang ordered his son Li Gan to break through the enemy's ranks. Li Gan and a few dozen men galloped through the left and right flanks of the enemy lines, then returned to report, “These Huns are easy to handle!” At this the other soldiers took heart again. Li Guang drew up his troops in a circle, the men facing outwards. The Huns attacked in force, arrows rained down; soon more than half of the Han soldiers had fallen, and their supply of arrows was nearly exhausted. Then Li Guang ordered his men to fit arrows to their bows but not to shoot. Meanwhile he aimed with his large yellow crossbow at the Hunnish leaders and killed several of them. After this the Huns attacked less fiercely. Night was falling and his officers and men were deathly pale but Li Guang remained calm and confident as he regrouped his forces. Ever after, he was a byword for courage in the army. The next day they again fought desperately until ZhangQian brought up reinforcements and the Huns retreated. The Han troops were too weary to give chase. Since Li Guang's men had nearly been wiped out, he gave up the fight and returned. According to the law, Zhang Qian should have been sentenced to death for arriving late; but he was permitted to ransom himself and become a commoner. LiGuang's achievement was cancelled out by his losses; hence he went unrewarded.</td>

In the fifth year of Yuanshuo, he served under Grand Marshal WeiQing as General of the Light Chariots in an expedition against the Western Prince of the Huns. His services in this campaign entitled him to be ennobled as the marquis of Lean. In the second year of Yuanshou, he succeeded Gongsun Hong as prime minister. Li Cai had slightly less than average ability and was far less famous than his cousin, yet Li Guang was never awarded a fief nor promoted above the rank of a high minister,while Li Cai became a marquis and one of the three highest officials in the land. Even some of Li Guang's own officers and men became marquises. Once Li Guang remarked in a casual conversation with the astrologer Wang Shuo," I have been in every campaign waged against the Huns,yet while several dozen officers of no more than average ability have been made marquises for their services I have neither been cited for merit nor granted a fief, althoughIam not inferior to them. Why is this? Have Igot the wrong face for a marquis? Or is this a matter of fate?” "Can you remember doing anything you later regretted?" asked Wang Shuo. “When I was governing Longxi and the Qiang tribes revolted, I tricked them into giving themselves up. But when more than eight hundred surrendered, I broke my promise to spare them and massacred them that same day. This is the one thing I really have on my conscience." "Nothing can be worse than killing those who have surrendered," replied Wang Shuo.“That must be why you have never been made a marquis.”</td>

This route was slightly longer and, since little water or grass was to be had there,the army could not pass that way in force. My post is in the vanguard," protested Li Guang,"yet you are ordering me to take the eastern route. Though I have been fighting the Huns since I was a lad, this is the first time I have had a chance to encounter the khan himself. I beg to be allowed to ride in the vanguard and be the first to attack him.” But Wei Qing had received secret orders from the emperor not to let Li Guang engage the khan, because he was old, and his luck had always been bad, and therefore he might easily fail again. Moreover Gongsun Ao, who had just lost his marquisate, was serving as the general of the centre and Wei Qing wanted him to have this chance to fight the khan. That was why he had removed Li Guang from his post. Knowing this, Li Guang begged Wei Qing to reconsider the matter, but the grand marshal dispatched his chief officer to him with a sealed note ordering him to report to Zhao Yiji without delay. Li Guang stormed off without even taking leave of the grand marshal. He led his troops to join the general of the right and they set out by the eastern route.But having no guide, they lost the way and failed to meet the main force at the time appointed. When Wei Qing joined battle with the Huns, the khan fled, and they had to return without having captured him.Riding southward across the desert, Wei Qing met the troops of Li Guang and Zhao Yiji; and Li Guang, seeing the grand marshal, rejoined the main force. Presently Wei Qing sent an officer with a gift of dried rice and wine to Li Guang. The man asked how he and Zhao Yiji had come to lose their way, as Wei Qing must send a detaild report of their misadventure to the emperor. BeforeLiGuang had time to explain, however, Wei Qing sent his chief officer to summon him to headquarters at once to stand trial. "My lieutenants were not to blame," declared Li Guang."I am the one responsible for losing the way. I shall answer for this myself before the tribunal.”</td>

An excellent archer, he was good to his men. Since his forbears for several generations had been military officers, Emperor Wu put Li Ling at the head of eight hundred horsemen. Once he led his troops over two thousand li into Hunnish territory, passed Lake Juyan and observed the lie of the land, but came back without having encountered any Huns. On his return he was appointed a cavalry commander at the head of five thousand men of Danyang in Chu; and for several years he trained them in archery and settled them in Jiuquan and Zhangye to defend the border against the Huns.</td>

Li Ling reached his objective, but as he was returning his troops were surrounded by eighty thousand Huns.He had only five thousand men, and soon their arrows were exhausted and more than half of them had fallen; yet they killed and wounded over ten thousand of the enemy, fighting a running battle for eight days as they withdrew. About a hundred li from Juyan, their road was cut by the Huns in a narrow glen. All their food was gone, there was no help at hand, and the enemy pressed their attack, calling upon them to surrender. "I could never face the emperor to report this!" cried Li Ling. And he surrendered to the Huns. His army was destroyed, only four hundred or so surviving to return.</td>

Yet the day that he died his sincerity and honesty had so impressed men that,whether they knew him or not, all mourned deeply for him.
