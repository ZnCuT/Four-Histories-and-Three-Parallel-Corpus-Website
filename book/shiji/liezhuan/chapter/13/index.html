                <td class="english-cell col-english" data-lang="english">After Li Si’s death, the Second Emperor promoted Zhao Gao to the position of chancellor within the palace. All affairs of state, whether great or small, were summarily decided by Zhao Gao. To test the weight of his authority, he presented a deer to the emperor but called it a horse. The Second Emperor questioned those around him, saying, “Surely this is a deer!” But those in attendance all replied, “It is a horse.” The Second Emperor, alarmed, supposed he must be suffering from some sort of delusion. He summoned the Grand Diviner and had him conduct a divination. The Grand Diviner replied, “When Your Majesty performs the suburban sacrifice in the spring and autumn and attends the spirits of the ancestral temples, the fasting and purification are not carried out in a clearcut manner. Therefore this has come about. You should rely upon your manifold virtue and be clearcut in your fasting and purification.” The emperor therefore retired to the Shanglin Park to fast and purify himself, though in fact he spent the days amusing himself in gaming and hunting. When a passerby happened into the park, the Second Emperor himself shot and killed the man. Zhao Gao instructed his daughter’s husband, Yan Yue, the magistrate of Xianyang, to bring charges, saying that someone of unknown identity had wantonly killed a man and moved the body to the Shanglin Park. Zhao Gao then admonished the Second Emperor, saying, “The Son of Heaven for no reason has wantonly killed an innocent man. Such conduct is forbidden by the Lord on High and unacceptable to the gods and spirits. Heaven will send down misfortune! You must retire far from the palace and carry out sacrifices!” The Second Emperor accordingly left the capital and took up residence in the Wangyi Palace.</td>

Zhao Gao then threatened him until he had forced him to commit suicide. Zhao Gao took the imperial seals and hung them from his own belt, but none of the hundred officials in attendance on the emperor would obey him. He mounted the throne room, but the throne room shook three times as though it would collapse. Zhao Gao realized then that Heaven would not sanction his action and that none of the officials would agree to it, and so he summoned a grandson of the First Emperor and turned over the seals to him.</td>
