With all seriousness, Your Majesty must order the Three Dukes to investigate the Regional Inspectors, Governors, and District Magistrates secretly. If these local officers are found to be abusive, or if it is discovered that they do not manage affairs harmoniously, they should be reported to Your Majesty. Moreover, Your Majesty must select and appoint honest and upright people who can enforce the laws and protect the people. Then it will be unnecessary to use military force to suppress the bandits, who will automatically disappear. Furthermore, there are more than two thousand Court Gentlemen of the Three Corps under the Chamberlain for Attendants, and many subordinates of the Three Dukes whose three-year service terms have expired but have not been promoted.
