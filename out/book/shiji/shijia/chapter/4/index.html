She found he lived in a poor lane at the foot of the city wall with only some worn-out matting as a door,yet with many wheel marks outside made by the carriages of prominent men. Upon her return home,Dame Zhang told her son Zhong,"I mean to marry my grand-daughter to Chen Ping." "That pauper who does nothing for a living!"protested her son. "He is the laughing-stock of the whole county.Why give him my daughter?” But Dame Zhang said,“A fine-looking man like Chen Ping will not always be poor."She married her grand-daughter to him,and since Chen Ping was poor she lent him money for the betrothal gifts as well as providing wine and meat at the wedding.Moreover she warned her grand-daughter,"Don't be disrespectful to him because he is poor. You must wait on his elder brother as if he were your father and on his sister-in-law as if she were your mother."After marrying this daughter of the Zhang family,Chen Ping be- come better off and acquired more connections.</td>

Upon Chen Ping's return,Xiang Yu sent Xiang Han to appoint him a chief commander and present him with twenty yiof gold.Almost at once,however,Liu Bang conquered Yin,and Xiang Yu in his rage decided to punish the officers in charge there.Chen Ping,afraid he would be executed,returned his gold and seal through a messenger to Xiang Yu and armed only with a sword fled alone by secret ways. When he was crossing the river,the boatman suspected that this fine-looking man travelling alone must be some run-away officer carrying gold,jade or other treasures.There was murder in the ferryman's eyes.Chen Ping stripped off his clothes in alarm and helped to punt the boat.The boatman saw that he had nothing,and gave up his plan.</td>

Liu Bang talked with him and was favourably impressed. "What post did you have in Chu?"he asked. Chen Ping answered,“I was an army officer.” That same day Liu Bang appointed him an army officer and his attendant in the royal carriage,making him the officer in charge of army discipline.The other officers were dumbfounded and complained, "The king has just got hold of this deserter from Chu and,with no idea of his ability,he is letting him share the royal carriage and control us." When Liu Bang heard this,he showed even greater favour to Chen Ping.The men of Han(206B.C.-8A.D.)marched east to attack Xiang Yu but suffered a reverse at Pengcheng and withdrew,regrouping their scattered forces at Xingyang.Chen Ping,made lieutenant general under King Xin of Han(403B.C.-230B.C.),encamped his troops at Guangwu.</td>

Those who give the most get good jobs,those who give little get infe- rior posts.He is obviously a dangerous turncoat.We hope you will look into this,sir." Liu Bang,his suspicions aroused,summoned Wei Wuzhi and re- proached him for recommending Chen Ping. "I recommended him for his ability,"replied Wei Wuzhi. "But Your Majesty is questioning his private conduct.If you had men with the virtue of Wei Sheng and Xiao Ji who could not help to win the war,what use would they be to you,sir?Now that Chu and Han(206B.C.-8A.D.)are fighting it out,all I consider when I recom- mend a brilliant strategist is whether his plans will benefit out state or not.What does it matter if he had an affair with his sister-in-law or accepted bribes?” Then Liu Bang sent for Chen Ping and reproached him saying, "You failed to do well in the service of Wei,then left the service of Chu,and now you have come to me.Is it right to chop and change so often?”"The king of Wei would not take my advice:that is why I left him to serve Xiang Yu,"said Chen Ping."But Xiang Yu is incapable of trusting others and employs or favours only his own clan or his wives' relatives,and is unable to make use of men of talent.That is why I left him.I came here because Your Majesty had the reputation of knowing how to use men.I arrived empty-handed and should have had nothing to live on had I not accepted some money.If my plans are any good, you can adopt them.If not,I still have the money and shall give it to the treasury,and then beg leave to go home.” Liu Bang apologized and loaded him with gifts,appointing him provost marshal to supervise the actions of all his generals,who after that dared say no more.</td>

The king said to Chen Ping,"The land is in utter confusion—shall we never have peace?” "King Xiang Yu is courteous and considerate,"answered Chen Ping."That is why men of honour who value ceremony flock to him. But when it comes to rewarding distinguished service with ranks and fiefs,he is tight-fisted,and for this reason no one stays with him long. You,sir,are so insulting and rude that men of honour do not come to you,while your generosity with fiefs make shameless fools who are out for profit flock to you.Could you get rid of both faults and adopt both virtues,you might pacify the empire as easily as raising a finger. But your overbearing ways will never win over men of honour.Of course,Chu is vulnerable too.Xiang Yu has only a few officers as staunch as Fan Zeng,Zhongli Mo,LongJu and Zhou Yin.If you,sir, would spend a few tens of thousands of pieces of gold to spread rumours and sow dissension between him and these men,he will doubt their loyalty.What with Xiang Yu's suspicious nature and his proneness to listen to slander,they are bound to be set at odds.Then if you raise an army to attack them,you will undoubtedly triumph.” Liu Bang,approving this plan,gave him forty thousand pieces of gold to use at his discretion,not asking for any account.</td>

Xiang Yu in his fury threw her corpse into the cauldron.So Wang Ling helped Liu Bang win the empire.But because he was friendly with Yong Chi,whom the emperor hated,and had not at first intended to follow the emperor,he was not enfeoffed as marquis of Anguo till late.</td>

When the emperor put the same question to the junior prime minister,Chen Ping replied,"There are officers in charge of such matters.” "What officers?"asked the emperor. "If you want to know about law-suits,sir,ask the chief justice," said Chen Ping."If you want to know about money and grain,ask the minister of revenue.” "If there are officers in charge of these matters,what is your function?"asked the emperor."Pardon my presumption,"answered Chen Ping humbly."Your Majesty,overestimating my mean capacity,has honoured me with the post of prime minister.The prime minister’s duty is to help his sover- eign to regulate the principles of yin and yang,to carry out projects according to the four seasons,to nurture all things,to control foreign tribes and the nobles,to rule the people with kindness and see that the ministers and officers perform their duties well.” The emperor approved of this answer.Zhou Bo,however,was thoroughly morified and once they were outside he reproached Chen Ping,saying,“You never taught me how to answer such questions.” Chen Ping retorted with a laugh,"You should know what your post entails.If His Majesty asked you the number of thieves and rob- bers in the capital,would you try to answer that too?” Then Zhou Bo realized how much inferior he was to Chen Ping.
