After a long while he announced, “If I become rich and famous, I will not forget the rest of you!” The other farm hands laughed and answered, “You are nothing but a hired labourer.

                <td class="english-cell col-english" data-lang="english">During the first year of the Second Emperor of Qin [209 BC], in the seventh month, an order came for a force of 900 men from the poor side of the town to be sent to garrison Yuyang. Chen She and Wu Guang were among those whose turn it was to go, and they were appointed heads of the levy of men. When the group had gone as far as Daze County, they encountered such heavy rain that the road became impassable. It was apparent that the men would be unable to reach the appointed place on time, an offence punishable by death. Chen She and Wu Guang accordingly began to plot together. “As things stand, we face death whether we stay or run away,” they said, “while if we were to start a revolt we would likewise face death. Since we must die in any case, would it not be better to die fighting for our country?” “The world has long suffered under Qin,” said Chen She. “From what I have heard, the Second Emperor was a younger son and ought never to have succeeded to the throne. The one who should have been made ruler was Prince Fusu. But because Fusu several times remonstrated with the former emperor, he was sent to lead the armies in the field. Someone has told me that, though Fusu was guilty of no crime, he has been murdered by the Second Emperor. The common people have heard much of Fusu’s worth, but they do not know that he is dead. Xiang Yan was a general of Chu who many times distinguished himself in battle. He took good care of his troops and the people of Chu thought fondly of him. Some say that he is dead, but others say that he is only in hiding. Now with the group we have, if we could deceive people into thinking that I am Fusu and you are Xiang Yan, we could lead the world in our own tune, and there are sure to be many who will join in the chorus!” Wu Guang approved of this idea, and they went to consult a diviner.</td>

                <td class="chinese-cell col-baihua" data-lang="baihua">但两人还有些犹豫，便去找人算卦。算卦的猜出了他们的心思，就说：“你们的事情都能办成，而且一定会有大功效。但是你们为什么不再去找鬼神算一卦呢?”陈胜、吴广听着心里高兴，又暗自琢磨这“找鬼神”是什么意思，后来他们恍然大悟：“这是教我们用装神弄鬼的办法来提高威信，以便组织群众啊!”于是他们在一条白绸带上写了“陈胜王”三个红字，偷偷塞进捕鱼人逮上来的一条鱼的肚子里，这条鱼又恰好被戍卒们买回来了，一剖腹，发现了鱼肚子里的这个红字条，人们觉得很奇怪。陈胜又让吴广夜里偷偷地到营房附近林中的破庙里，点起灯笼，像狐狸似地嗥叫：“大楚兴，陈胜王!”戍卒们都被吓得一夜没有睡好觉。第二天早晨，戍卒们三三两两交头接耳地开始议论，同时还指指点点地斜着眼睛看陈胜。</td>

But might you not seek your fortune with the spirits?” Chen She and Wu Guang were delighted with the idea of enlisting supernatural aid in their scheme. “It must mean that we should first do something to overawe the men in our group!” they declared, and proceeded to write with cinnabar on a piece of silk: “Chen She shall be a king.” They stuffed the silk into the belly of a fish someone had caught in a net. When one of the soldiers bought the fish and boiled it for his dinner, he discovered the message in the fish’s belly and was greatly astonished. Also Chen She secretly sent Wu Guang to a grove of trees surrounding a shrine which was close to where the men were making camp. When night fell, Wu Guang lit a torch and, partly concealing it under a basket, began to wail like a fox and cry, “Great Chu shall rise again! Chen She shall be a king!” The soldiers were filled with alarm, and when dawn came they talked here and there among themselves, pointing and staring at Chen She.</td>

                <td class="english-cell col-english" data-lang="english">Wu Guang had always been kind to others and many of the soldiers would do anything for him. When the officer in command of the group was drunk, Wu Guang made a point of openly announcing several times that he was going to run away. In this way Wu Guang hoped to arouse the commander’s anger, get him to punish him, and so stir up the men’s ire and resentment. As Wu Guang had expected, the commander began to beat him, when the commander’s sword slipped out of its scabbard. Wu Guang sprang up, seized the sword, and killed the commander, Chen She rushed to his assistance, and they proceeded to kill the other two commanding officers as well. Then they called together all the men of the group and announced: “Because of the rain we encountered, we cannot reach our rendezvous on time. And anyone who misses a rendezvous has his head cut off! Even if you should somehow escape with your heads, six or seven out of every ten of you are bound to die in the course of garrison duty. Now, my brave fellows, if you are unwilling to die, we have nothing more to say. But if you would risk death, then let us risk it for the sake of fame and glory! Kings and nobles, generals and ministers — such men are made, not born!” The men of the garrison all replied, “We’ll do whatever you say!” Then, in order to win the loyalty of the people, Chen She and Wu Guang falsely proclaimed themselves to be Prince Fusu and Xiang Yan. Baring their right shoulders, they raised the cry of “Great Chu!” and built an altar and swore an oath before it, offering as a sacrifice the heads of the commanding officers. Chen She set himself up as commander of the army, with Wu Guang as his colonel, and together they attacked Daze County. After capturing Daze County, they proceeded to attack and capture Qi. They dispatched Ge Ying, a man of Fuli, with a force to seize control of the area east of Qi, while they themselves attacked Zhi, Zan, Ku, Zhe, and Qiao, all of which submitted. Recruiting soldiers as they went along, they were able by the time they reached the city of Chen to build up a force of 600 or 700 chariots, over 1,000 horsemen, and 20,000 or 30,000 infantry. When they attacked Chen, neither the governor of the province nor any of the magistrates of the districts under him were in the city. Only one of the governor’s aides was present, who engaged them in battle at the Qiao Gate but was defeated and killed. They entered the city and quartered there for several days, sending out an order summoning all the village heads and important men of the region to meet with them and plan a course of action. To this the village heads and distinguished men replied, “The general has buckled on armor and taken up his weapons to attack the unrighteous and punish the violence of Qin, that he may restore once more the sacred altars of the state of Chu. Because of the glory he has won, he deserves to be made a king.” Chen She accordingly was made king and given the title “Magnifier of Chu,”</td>

But the chief minister, Cai Ci, interceded, saying, “Qin, our great enemy, has not yet been destroyed. Now if you execute the families of the king of Zhao and his ministers, you will only create a second Qin to plague us. It would be better to comply with what Wu Chen and the others have done and confirm their positions.” Chen She accordingly dispatched an envoy to congratulate Wu Chen on his new position as king of Zhao, but the families of Wu Chen and the others he had transferred to his own palace and kept under guard. Zhang Er’s son, Zhang Ao, he enfeoffed as lord of Chengdu. Chen She urged the troops of Zhao to proceed with all haste to the area within the Pass, but Zhao’s generals and ministers plotted with their king, saying, “It was not Chen She’s intention that you should become king of Zhao. When he has finished conquering Qin, he will assuredly turn his forces against us. The best plan, therefore, would be for us not to dispatch troops west, but instead to send a force north to seize the region of Yan and broaden the territory under your command. With the Yellow River to protect Zhao in the south, and Yan and Dai to the north in our possession, Chen She in Chu will not dare try to impose his will upon us, even if he is victorious over Qin. And if Chen She should fail to conquer Qin, he will be forced to rely more heavily than ever upon us. At that point we can take advantage of the damage already inflicted upon Qin by Chen She and have our way with the whole empire!” The king of Zhao approved their suggestion and sent no troops west, but instead dispatched Han Guang, a former troop commander of the province of Shanggu, to lead an army north and seize the region of Yan.</td>

It has no strength left to interfere with what we do. Chen She, in spite of all his power, did not dare to harm the families of the king and ministers of Zhao. How should Zhao dare to do any harm to your family?” Han Guang, considering that what they said was true, declared himself king of Yan.

When he had become king and was ruling the region of Chen, one of his old friends who had once worked as a hired hand with him in the fields heard of his success and went and knocked upon the palace gate of Chen, saying, “I want to see She!” The gatekeeper was about to order him arrested, but he managed to convince the keeper that he was an old friend of Chen She. The gatekeeper let him go, but refused to allow him to enter the palace. When the king emerged from the palace, the man stood by the roadside and shouted “She!” Hearing his voice, Chen She ordered that he be brought forward and, inviting him to ride in his carriage, returned with him to the palace. When the man entered the palace and saw all its great halls with their curtains and trappings he said, “Oh, a heap of stuff you have, She, now you’re a king! Such a big place!” (The people of Chu say “a heap” when they mean a lot.) Eventually the story spread all over the empire, so that from this incident with Chen She originated the saying “Even ‘heap-of-She’ got to be king.” After this the old friend came often to visit Chen She, making himself more and more at home in the palace and telling people about Chen She’s life in the old days. Someone warned Chen She about this, saying, “This guest of yours is ignorant and ill-bred, and his idle chatter serves only to degrade your dignity!” Chen She had his old friend’s head cut off. Thereafter all of Chen She’s former acquaintances withdrew of their own accord, and no one attempted to be on intimate terms with him. Chen She appointed Zhu Fang as rectifier and Hu Wu as director of faults, putting them in charge of his other ministers and officials. When any of the various generals returned from expeditions to seize territory, if it appeared that they had not carried out their orders exactly, these two officials believed it their duty to bind them like criminals and subject them to the severest examination. If any fault was found in their behaviour, their case was not submitted to the lesser officials for trial, but was settled summarily by Zhu Fang and Hu Wu themselves. Chen She entrusted everything to these two men with the fullest confidence, and for this reason his generals felt no personal attachment to him. This is why he failed.</td>
