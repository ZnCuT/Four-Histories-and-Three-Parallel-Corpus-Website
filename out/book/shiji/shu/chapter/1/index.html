The cauldrons were handed down during the successive dynasties of the Xia and Shang, but later, when the virtue of the Zhou rulers declined and the altars of the soil of the state of Song, ruled by the descendants of the Shang kings, were destroyed, the cauldrons sank into the waters and disappeared from sight.
