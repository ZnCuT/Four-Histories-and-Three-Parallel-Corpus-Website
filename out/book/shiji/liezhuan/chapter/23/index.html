The reason they met death is that they were beguiled by greed and profit and did not know when to stop. “Therefore the sage lays down codes of behaviour and regulates desires, observing moderation in what he exacts from the people, employing them only in the proper season and seeing that they have some rest from their labours. Hence his ambitions are never excessive, his actions are not arrogant; he is at all times in accord with the Way and never goes astray. And hence the world acquiesces and never turns against him. “Long ago Duke Huan of Qi nine times called the other feudal lords together, and in one stroke brought order to the world. But at the meeting at Sunflower Hill he showed himself arrogant and boastful in his ambitions, and nine of the feudal states turned against him. King Fuchai of Wu had armies unrivalled by anyone in the world, but in his daring and might he was contemptuous of the other feudal rulers and lorded it over Qi and Jin, and therefore in the end he met death and his kingdom perished. Xia Yu and the grand historian Jiao roared so loud they startled the Three Armies, but both died at the hands of common soldiers. These men all rode on a wave of splendid success and failed to return to the principle of the Way. They suffered because they did not assume a humble and retiring posture or observe restraint and moderation.</td>

He adjusted scales, standardized measures, and made weights uniform. He broke down the barriers in the fields in order to stabilize the livelihood of the people, unify their customs, and encourage them to devote themselves to agriculture and get the greatest benefit from the soil. One family was not to pursue two occupations, but to work the fields and store up produce, and also to practise the arts of war. Hence when the troops were put into action, the territory of the state was extended, and when the troops were at rest, the state enjoyed prosperity. As a result, Qin stood unrivalled in the world, able to overawe the other feudal lords and fulfil the destiny of the state. But after Lord Shang had accomplished all these deeds, in the end he was torn in two by carriages.</td>
