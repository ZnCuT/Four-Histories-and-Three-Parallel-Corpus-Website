莽独孤贫，因折节为恭俭。

After a long time, his paternal uncle who was younger than [Wang Mang's] father, the Marquis of Ch'eng-tu, [Wang] Shang, memorialized that he wished to divide the households of his estate in order to enfeoff [Wang Mang]. Moreover, the Privy Treasurer of the Ch'ang-lo [Palace], Tai Ch'ung, the Palace Attendant, Chin Shê, the Colonel of Northern Barbarian Cavalry, Chi Hung, the Chief Commandant of Shang-ku [Commandery], Yang Ping, and the Gentleman-of-the-Household, Ch'en T'ang, who were all gentlemen well-known in that age, all spoke in behalf of [Wang] Mang.

[Wang Mang] took advantage of [this information and informed] the Commander-in-chief, the Marquis of Ch'ü-yang, [Wang] Ken, who had him speak [to the Empress Dowager and the Emperor. Thereupon, Shun-yü] Chang suffered execution. From this [deed, Wang] Mang obtained [a reputation] for straightforwardness. A discussion is in the "Memoir of [Shun-yü] Chang."

When [Wang] Mang had surpassed his equals and succeeded his four uncles, [Wang Feng, Wang Shang, Wang Yin, and Wang Ken], as chief assistant in the government, he wished to make his fame and reputation surpass that of his predecessors, hence he denied himself tirelessly and invited the Capable and Good [to come to him], making them Division Head Clerks.

[Wang] Mang [hence] presented to the Emperor a request begging to retire. Emperor Ai [however] sent his Prefect of the Masters of Writing, [T'ang Lin], with an imperial edict to [Wang] Mang, saying, "The late Emperor entrusted the government to you, sir, whereupon he departed from his subjects. We have obtained [the opportunity] to uphold the [imperial] ancestral temples and will in truth consider [Ourself] fortunate to be of the same mind and similar opinions with you, sir. Now you, sir, have sent [Us a letter saying that you] are ill and ask to retire. Thereby you make known that We are not able to uphold or follow the intentions of the late Emperor.

[The Emperor] also sent the Lieutenant Chancellor, K'ung Kuang, the Grand Minister of Works, Ho Wu, the General of the Left, Shih Tan, and the Commandant of the Palace Guard, Fu Hsi, to speak to the [Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Wang], saying, "The Emperor has heard of the Empress Dowager's imperial edict and is much saddened.

大司马即不起，皇帝即不敢听政。”

If the Commander-in-chief [Wang Mang] does not arise, the Emperor will then not presume to attend to the government."

当时哀帝的祖母定陶傅太后、母亲丁姬都在世，高昌侯董宏上书说：“按照《春秋》的义理，母亲凭借儿子而尊贵，丁姬应当加上尊号。”
At that time, the grandmother of Emperor Ai, the Queen Dowager [nee] Fu of Ting-t'ao, and his mother, the Concubine nee Ting [of the deceased King of Ting-t'ao], were alive, so the Marquis of Kao-ch'ang, Tung Hung, presented to the throne a letter saying, "According to the principles of the Spring and Autumn [in the Kung-yang Commentary], a mother becomes honorable because of her son, so that the Concubine [nee] Ting should be presented with the imperial title [of Empress Dowager]."

莽案行，责内者令曰：“定陶太后，藩妾也，何以得与至尊并！”彻去，更设坐。
王莽巡视时，斥责内者令说：“定陶太后是诸侯的姬妾，怎么能和最尊贵的太皇太后并列！”于是撤去帐幕，重新设置座位。
Wang] Mang investigated and reproached the Prefect of the Flunkies, saying, "The Queen Dowager of [the kingdom of] Ting-t'ao is a concubine from a tributary [kingdom]. How could she be permitted to be honored equally with the most honorable [lady in the palace]? Take it away and put the seat [of the Queen Dowager of Ting-t'ao] at a different [place]."

傅太后闻之，大怒，不肯会，重怨恚莽。
傅太后听说后，非常愤怒，不肯参加宴会，对王莽深怀怨恨。

王莽又请求退休，哀帝赏赐王莽五百斤黄金，一辆安车和四匹马，让他辞官回家。

过了两年，傅太后、丁姬都被加上尊号，丞相朱博上奏说：“王莽先前不弘扬尊崇尊长的大义，压制贬低尊号，损害孝道，应当被公开处死。
The second year afterwards, when the Queen Dowager [nee] Fu and the Concubine [nee] Ting had both been given the imperial titles [of Emperor's Great Empress Dowager and the Emperor's Empress Dowager, respectively], the Lieutenant Chancellor Chu Po memorialized, "[Wang] Mang has not previously applied broadly [enough] the principle of honoring those [deserving of] honor but has humbled and degraded those who should be honored with an imperial title, [thereby] injuring the doctrine of filial piety, so that he ought to suffer public execution.

幸蒙赦令，不宜有爵土，请免为庶人。”
幸亏得到赦免的命令，但不应当拥有爵位和封地，请求将他免为平民。”
Fortunately [for him], he has received [the advantage of a general] ordinance of amnesty, [yet] it is not proper that he should possess a noble title or land. I beg that he be dismissed [from his titles] and made a commoner."

上曰：“以莽与太皇太后有属，勿免，遣就国。”
皇上说：“因为王莽和太皇太后有亲属关系，不要免去他的爵位，遣送他回封国。”

The Emperor therefore summoned [Wang] Mang [to come to court].

当初王莽回到封国时，南阳太守因为王莽身份尊贵重要，选拔门下掾宛县人孔休担任新都国相。
When [Wang] Mang had first gone to his estate, because [Wang] Mang was an honorable and important [personage], the Grand Administrator of Nan-yang [Commandery] selected a Division Head from his office, K'ung Hsiu, [a man of] Yüan, to be the acting Chancellor of Hsin-tu, [Wang Mang's marquisate.

后来王莽生病，孔休前去问候，王莽趁着情谊，送上镶有玉饰的宝剑，想与他交好。
Later, when [Wang] Mang was ill, [K'ung] Hsiu attended upon him. Because of his gracious intent, [Wang] Mang presented him with his [own] precious sword having jade furnishings, desiring to make [K'ung Hsiu] a good friend.

休不肯受，莽因曰：“诚见君面有瘢，美玉可以灭瘢，欲献其瑑耳。”
孔休不肯接受，王莽于是说：“我确实看到您脸上有疤痕，美玉可以消除疤痕，我想献上剑上的玉饰罢了。”
[But K'ung] Hsiu refused to receive it. [Wang] Mang said therefore, "I verily see that on your face, sir, there is a scar. A fine jade can extinguish a scar. I merely wanted to present you with the ring on the hilt of the sword."

即解其瑑，休复辞让。
随即解下剑上的玉饰，孔休又一次推辞。
He immediately loosed its [jade] sword-ring. When [K'ung] Hsiu again excused himself and refused.

莽曰：“君嫌其贾邪？”遂椎碎之，自裹以进休，休乃受。
王莽说：“您是嫌它贵重吗？”于是捶碎了玉饰，亲自包起来送给孔休，孔休才接受了。
[Wang] Mang said, "Do you, sir, dislike [to receive it] because of its [high] value?" Then he pounded it to pieces, himself tied it up, and thereupon presented it to [K'ung] Hsiu. [K'ung] Hsiu then received it.

王莽回到京城一年多，哀帝去世，没有儿子，而且傅太后、丁太后都已去世，太皇太后当天驾车前往未央宫收取玺印绶带，派使者疾驰去召王莽。
More than a year after [Wang] Mang returned to the imperial capital, Emperor Ai died. He had no children and both the [August Grand] Empress Dowager [nee Fu] and the [Emperor's] Empress Dowager [nee] Ting had died previously. On the same day [as the death], the Grand August Empress Dowager [nee Wang] rode a quadriga to the Wei-yang Palace, where she secured the imperial seals with their seal-cords.

On the same day, [Tung] Hsien committed suicide.

王莽因为大司徒孔光是著名的儒者，曾辅佐三位君主，受到太后的敬重，天下人都信任他，于是极力尊敬侍奉孔光，推荐孔光的女婿甄邯担任侍中奉车都尉。
Because the Grand Minister Over the Masses, K'ung Kuang, was a famous scholar, had acted as chancellor to three lords [of men], was respected by the [Grand] Empress Dowager, and the whole empire trusted him, [Wang] Mang therefore honored [K'ung] Kuang greatly and served him. [Wang Mang] introduced [to the court K'ung] Kuang's son-in-law, Chen Han, and made him a Palace Attendant and the Chief Commandant of the Imperial Equipages.

对于那些哀帝的外戚以及在位大臣中平时不喜欢的人，王莽都罗织他们的罪名，写成弹劾的奏书草稿，让甄邯拿给孔光。

孔光一向胆小谨慎，不敢不上奏，王莽禀告太后，总是批准这些奏书。
[K'ung] Kuang was habitually timid and cautious, so did not dare to refuse to send in these memorials [as his own]. Each time [they were received, Wang] Mang advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to assent to these memorials.

于是前将军何武、后将军公孙禄坐互相称举，免。
于是前将军何武、后将军公孙禄因互相推举而获罪，被免职。
In this way, the General of the Van, Ho Wu, and the General of the Rear, Kung-sun Lu, were sentenced for having recommended each other and were dismissed.

丁、傅及董贤亲属皆免官爵，徙远方。
丁氏、傅氏以及董贤的亲属都被免除官爵，迁徙到远方。
The relatives of the Ting and Fu [clans], together with [those of] Tung Hsien were all dismissed from their positions and from their noble titles and were exiled to distant regions.

红阳侯立，太后亲弟，虽不居位，莽以诸父内敬惮之，畏立从容言太后，令己不得肆意，乃复令光奏立旧恶：
红阳侯王立，是太后的亲弟弟，虽然不在官位，王莽因为他是叔父，内心敬畏他，担心王立从容地对太后进言，使自己不能肆意行事，于是又让孔光上奏王立过去的罪过：
The Marquis of Hung-yang, [Wang] Li, was a younger [half]-brother of the [Grand] Empress Dowager. Although he did not occupy any [official] position, yet because he was one of his uncles who was respected within [the Palace, Wang Mang] dreaded him. He feared [Wang] Li might casually say something to the [Grand] Empress Dowager which would bring it about that [Wang Mang] would not be permitted to follow his own intentions. So [Wang Mang] had [K'ung] Kuang also memorialize [Wang] Li's former evil deeds.

“前知定陵侯淳于长犯大逆罪，多受其赂，为言误朝；
“以前知道定陵侯淳于长犯了大逆不道之罪，却接受他很多贿赂，为他说话，误导朝廷；
that he had previously known that the Marquis of Ting-ling, Shun-yü Chang, had committed the crime of rebellion and he had [nevertheless] received from him a large bribe and had falsely spoken for him, [thus] misleading the court.

后白以官婢杨寄私子为皇子，众言曰吕氏、少帝复出，纷纷为天下所疑，难以示来世，成襁褓之功。
后来又说官婢杨寄的私生子是皇子，众人都说这是吕氏、少帝的情况再次出现，纷纷被天下人怀疑，难以昭示后代，成就幼年君主的功业。
Later he had advised that a secret son of a government woman, Yang Chi, [allegedly by Emperor Ch'eng], should be made an Imperial Son, [a possible heir to the throne. But] the common opinion [in the court was, "It is a case of] the reappearance of the Young Emperor of the Lü clan. It is most disturbing. It would be suspicious to the empire, so that it would be difficult to establish [such a babe's legitimacy] to later generations or to achieve anything creditable in behalf of [such a babe] in swaddling clothes."

请遣立就国。”
请求打发王立前往封国。”
[The memorial] begged that [Wang] Li should be sent back to his state.

太后不听，莽曰：“今汉家衰，比世无嗣，太后独代幼主统政，诚可畏惧，力用公正先天下，尚恐不从，今以私恩逆大臣议，如此，群下倾邪，乱从此起！
太后不肯听从，王莽说：“如今汉家衰落，接连几代没有子嗣，太后独自代替幼主治理国政，实在令人畏惧，尽力做到公正为天下人做表率，还恐怕有人不顺从，现在因为私人恩情违背大臣的建议，这样一来，群臣会倾向奸邪，祸乱就会从此产生！
When the [Grand] Empress Dowager would not listen to it, [Wang] Mang said to her, "Now the Han dynasty has decayed and has been without [natural] heirs [to the throne] for successive generations. You alone, [Grand] Empress Dowager, can take the place of the young lord in directing the government. It is sincerely to be dreaded that, even if you strive hard to use justice and uprightness in leading the empire, it is yet to be feared that [the empire] will not follow [you. But] now if for the sake of your private affection you go contrary to the advice of your highest officials, in this way your many subordinates will become dangerous and evil; disorder will arise because of this [event].

宜可且遣就国，安后复征召之。”
应该暂且打发他前往封国，待局势安定后再征召他回来。”
It is proper to approve [this petition], temporarily send [Wang Li] to his state, and, after the situation has become more tranquil, to summon him back."

太后不得已，遣立就国。
太后没有办法，打发王立前往封国。
The [Grand] Empress Dowager had no alternative, so sent [Wang] Li to his state.

莽之所以胁持上下，皆此类也。
王莽用来胁迫控制上下的手段，都是这类做法。
The [methods] by which [Wang] Mang compelled and controlled his superiors and inferiors were all of the foregoing sort.

于是附顺者拔擢，忤恨者诛灭。
于是依附顺从他的人得到提拔，违逆怨恨他的人遭到诛杀。
In this way, those who attached themselves to him and accorded with him were promoted and those who opposed or disliked him were exterminated.

王舜、王邑为腹心，甄丰、甄邯主击断，平晏领机事，刘歆典文章，孙建为爪牙。
王舜、王邑是他的心腹，甄丰、甄邯负责决断，平晏掌管机密事务，刘歆主管典章制度，孙建是他的得力助手。
Wang Shun and Wang Yi became his intimate advisers. Chen Feng and Chen Han had charge of making decisions, P'ing Yen had charge of delicate matters, Liu Hsin took care of [classical] literature, Sun Chien was his military assistant.

丰子寻、歆子棻、涿郡崔发、南阳陈崇皆以材能幸于莽。
甄丰的儿子甄寻、刘歆的儿子刘棻、涿郡人崔发、南阳人陈崇都因有才能而得到王莽的宠幸。
[Chen] Feng's son, [Chen] Hsün, [Liu] Hsin's son, [Liu] Fen, Ts'ui Fa from Cho Commandery, and Ch'en Ch'ung from Nan-yang [Commandery] were all favored by [Wang] Mang because of their ability.

莽色厉而言方，欲有所为，微见风采，党与承其指意而显奏之，莽稽首涕泣，固推让焉，上以惑太后，下用示信于众庶。
王莽外表严厉而言辞方正，想要做什么事情，只略微露出一点迹象，党羽便秉承他的旨意而公开上奏，王莽则磕头流泪，坚决推辞，对上以此迷惑太后，对下以此向百姓显示诚信。
[Wang] Mang's appearance was severe and his speech was blunt. When he wanted to have something done, he subtly indicated it in his bearing; his clique took up his intentions and manifested them in a memorial, [whereupon Wang] Mang bent his head to the earth with tears in his eyes, and firmly declined. On the one hand, he thereby misled the [Grand] Empress Dowager, and on the other, he thereby exhibited faithfulness to the mass of commoners.

始，风益州令塞外蛮夷献白雉，元始元年正月，莽白太后下诏，以白雉荐宗庙。
起初，暗示益州刺史让塞外蛮夷进献白雉，元始元年正月，王莽禀告太后下诏书，用白雉祭祀宗庙。
First, he had hinted that [the Governor of] Yi Province should induce the barbarians outside the barrier to present a white pheasant, and, in the first year of [the period] Yüan-shih, in the first month, [Wang] Mang advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict that the white pheasant should be offered in the [imperial] ancestral temples.

群臣因奏言太后：“委任大司马莽定策安宗庙。
大臣们于是上奏太后说：“委托大司马王莽定策安定宗庙。
The many courtiers therefore memorialized, saying, "The [Grand] Empress Dowager entrusted to the Commander-in-chief, [Wang] Mang, the duty of planning the imperial enthronement that gave peace to the [imperial] ancestral temples.

故大司马霍光有安宗庙之功，益封三万户，畴其爵邑，比萧相国。
前大司马霍光有安定宗庙的功劳，增加封邑三万户，他的爵位和封邑世世相传，与萧相国相同。
When the former Commander-in-chief Ho Kuang had the merit of [similarly] having given peace to the [imperial] ancestral temples, his enfeoffment was increased by thirty thousand households, the noble title and estate [of his posterity was ordered] to be the same [as that of the founder of their house, and he was ranked] the same as the [former] Chancellor of State Hsiao [Ho].

莽宜如光故事。”
王莽应当按照霍光的旧例办理。”
It would be proper for [Wang] Mang to be [treated] as [Ho] Kuang was formerly [treated]."

太后问公卿曰：“诚以大司马有大功当著之邪？将以骨肉故欲异之也？”
太后问公卿们说：“果真因为大司马有大功应当表彰他呢？还是因为他是骨肉之亲才想要特殊对待他呢？”
The [Grand] Empress Dowager questioned the ministers, saying, "Is it really that, because the Commander-in-chief, [Wang] Mang, has achieved great merit, he ought to be given [high] honors? Or is it because he is of [Our] flesh and blood that you have wanted to distinguish him?"

于是群臣乃盛陈：“莽功德致周成白雉之瑞，千载同符。
于是大臣们极力陈述：“王莽的功德招致了像周成王时出现的白雉祥瑞，千年之间符命相同。
Thereupon various courtiers produced long expositions, [saying, "Wang] Mang's achievements and virtuous conduct have brought about the auspicious presage of a white pheasant [as at the time the Duke of] Chou [was minister to King] Ch'eng. That in a thousand years there are similarities is a law of the sage-kings.

圣王之法，臣有大功则生有美号，故周公及身在而托号于周。
圣王的法度，臣子有大功的，在世时就有美好的称号，所以周公在世时就以周为称号。
When a subject has great achievements, in his lifetime he should have a laudable title. Hence the Duke of Chou, during his lifetime, was given a title with [the name of] the Chou [dynasty in it.

莽有定国安汉家之大功，宜赐号曰安汉公，益户，畴爵邑，上应古制，下准行事，以顺天心。”
王莽有安定国家、使汉家安宁的大功，应当赐封号为安汉公，增加封户，使爵位和封邑世世相传，上符合古代制度，下参照近代事例，以顺应天意。
[Wang] Mang has the great achievement of having given stability to the state and of having given tranquillity to the Han dynasty, so that it is proper that he should be granted the title, `The Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han [Dynasty],' that the [number of] households [in his noble estate] should be increased, and [his posterity should be given] the same noble title and estate [as the founder of their house]. On the one hand, [this appointment] will be in accordance with ancient principles, and on the other hand, it will take as its model past situations. Thereby it will accord with the mind of Heaven."

太后诏尚书具其事。
太后诏令尚书办理这件事。
When the [Grand] Empress Dowager, in an imperial edict, ordered a Master of Writing to prepare [an edict for] this matter.

莽上书言：“臣与孔光、王舜、甄丰、甄邯共定策，今愿独条光等功赏，寝置臣莽，勿随辈列。”
王莽上书说：“我和孔光、王舜、甄丰、甄邯共同定策，现在希望只列出孔光等人的功劳和赏赐，搁置我王莽，不要把我和他们放在一起。”
[Wang] Mang presented a letter which said, "Your servant planned the enthronement [of Emperor P'ing] together with K'ung Kuang, Wang Shun, Chen Feng, and Chen Han. Now I wish that the achievements and rewards of [K'ung] Kuang and the others should alone be listed and that [any rewards for] your servant, Mang, should be abandoned and set aside. Do not list me with them."

甄邯白太后下诏曰：“‘无偏无党，王道荡荡。’
甄邯禀告太后下诏书说：“‘不偏私不结党，王道宽广平坦。’
Chen Han advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict, which said, "`Without deflection and without partiality, Great is the way of [true] Kings.'

君有安宗庙之功，不可以骨肉故蔽隐不扬。
您有安定宗庙的功劳，不能因为是骨肉之亲就隐瞒不宣扬。
Although a relative should be loved, [yet We] should not be partial to him. [But] you, sir, have achieved the merit of having given tranquillity to the [imperial] ancestral temples. [We] cannot set aside [your merits] and not exalt them just because you are of [Our] flesh and blood.

君其勿辞。”
您不要推辞。”
You, sir, must not refuse."

莽复上书让。
王莽又上书推辞。
When [Wang] Mang again presented a letter excusing himself.

太后令谒者引莽待殿东箱，莽称疾不肯入。
太后命令谒者引导王莽到宫殿东厢房等候，王莽称病不肯进入。
the [Grand] Empress Dowager by an imperial edict ordered an Internuncio to lead [Wang] Mang to await [investiture] in the Eastern Wing of the [Palace] Hall. [But Wang] Mang pronounced himself ill and would not enter [the Palace Hall.

太后使尚书令姚恂谕曰：“君以选故而辞以疾，君任重，不可阙，宜及时起。”
太后派尚书令姚恂劝谕说：“您因为选任的缘故称病推辞，您责任重大，不能缺席，应当及时起身。”
so the Grand] Empress Dowager sent the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, [Yao] Hsün, with an imperial edict to [Wang Mang], saying, "Because you, sir, are humble, you have refused on account of illness. Your position, sir, is important, and may not be left vacant. Arise promptly at this time."

莽遂固辞。
王莽最终坚决推辞。
When [Wang] Mang completely and firmly refused.

太后复使长信太仆闳承制召莽，莽固称疾。
太后又派长信太仆王闳秉承诏令召见王莽，王莽坚决称病。
the [Grand] Empress Dowager again sent the Grand Coachman at the Ch'ang-hsin [Palace, Wang] Hung, with an imperial decree summoning [Wang] Mang. [Wang] Mang [however] insistently pronounced himself ill.

左右白太后，宜勿夺莽意，但条孔光等，莽乃肯起。
身边的人禀告太后，应该不要违背王莽的意愿，只列出孔光等人的功劳，王莽才肯起身。
Her entourage advised the [Grand] Empress Dowager that it was proper not to force [Wang] Mang's will, and merely to list K'ung Kuang and the others, whereupon [Wang] Mang would be willing to arise.

四月，太后下诏曰：“太傅博山侯光宿卫四世，世为傅相，忠考仁笃，行义显著，建议定策，益封万户，以光为太师，与四辅之政。
四月，太后下诏说：“太傅博山侯孔光在四世君主在位期间担任宿卫，世代担任太傅、丞相，忠诚孝顺、仁爱笃厚，行为道义显著，建议定策，增加封邑一万户，任命孔光为太师，参与四辅的政务。
The [Grand] Empress Dowager [thereupon] issued to her subordinates an imperial edict, saying, "The Grand Tutor, the Marquis of Po-shan, [K'ung] Kuang, has guarded [the throne] for four reigns and from reign to reign has been tutor or chancellor. He is loyal, filial, benevolent, and sincere; his conduct and his fealty have been outstanding. He made the proposal and planned the imperial enthronement. He shall be additionally enfeoffed with [the income of] ten thousand households. [K'ung] Kuang shall become the Grand Master, participating in a government by Four Coadjutors.

车骑将军安阳侯舜积累仁孝，使迎中山王，折冲万里，功德茂著，益封万户，以舜为太保。
车骑将军安阳侯王舜积累仁孝之行，奉命迎接中山王，在万里之外挫败敌人，功德卓著，增加封邑一万户，任命王舜为太保。
"The General of Chariots and Cavalry, the Marquis of An-yang, [Wang] Shun, has repeatedly and continually been benevolent and filial; he was sent to invite the King of Chung-shan, [Liu Chi-tzu, to ascend the throne] and he has `repulsed [by diplomacy] the attacks of [the enemy at a distance of] ten thousand li.' His achievements and virtuous conduct are abundant and brilliant. He shall be additionally enfeoffed with [the income of] ten thousand households. [Wang] Shun shall become the Grand Guardian.

左将军光禄勋丰宿卫三世，忠信仁笃，使迎中山王，辅导共养，以安宗庙，封丰为广阳侯，食邑五千户，以丰为少傅。
左将军光禄勋甄丰在三世君主在位期间担任宿卫，忠诚守信、仁爱笃厚，奉命迎接中山王，辅导供养，使宗庙安宁，封甄丰为广阳侯，食邑五千户，任命甄丰为少傅。
"The General of the Left and Superintendent of the Imperial Household, [Chen] Feng, has guarded [the throne] for three reigns. He is loyal, trustworthy, benevolent, and sincere. He was sent to invite the King of Chung-shan [to ascend the throne] and has assisted and guided him and supplied his needs, thereby giving tranquillity to the [imperial] ancestral temples. [Chen] Feng shall be enfeoffed as Marquis of Kuang-yang with the income of a state of 5000 households. [Chen] Feng shall become the Junior Tutor.

皆授四辅之职，畴其爵邑，各赐第一区。
以上三人都授予四辅的职务，他们的爵位和封邑世代相传，各赐第一等的宅第一处。
"Upon all [these persons] there shall be conferred the position [of being included among] the Four Coadjutors. Their noble ranks and estates shall be the same [for their descendants as for the founders of their houses] and to each shall be given one residence.

侍中奉车都尉邯宿卫勤劳，建议定策，封邯为承阳侯，食邑二千四百户。”
侍中奉车都尉甄邯在宿卫岗位上勤劳任职，建议定策，封甄邯为承阳侯，食邑二千四百户。
"The Palace Attendant and Chief Commandant of Imperial Equipages, [Chen] Han, has guarded the throne and toiled diligently. He made the proposal and planned the imperial enthronement. [Chen] Han shall be enfeoffed as the Marquis of Ch'eng-yang with the income of an estate of two thousand four hundred households."

四人既受赏，莽尚未起，群臣复上言：“莽虽克让，朝所宜章，以时加赏，明重元功，无使百僚元元失望。”
四人接受赏赐后，王莽还没有起身任职，大臣们又上奏说：“王莽虽然能够谦让，但朝廷应当表彰他，及时加以赏赐，明确重视首功之臣，不要让百官和百姓失望。”
When these four persons had received rewards and [Wang] Mang had not even yet arisen, various courtiers again presented [a memorial to the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang], saying, "Although [Wang] Mang is able to yield [to others, yet] he is one whom the court should properly make illustrious and to whom should be given at [this appropriate] time [suitable] rewards, [thereby] making well-known and important one who has achieved great merits and [thereby] not causing the hopes of the many officials or of the great multitude to be disappointed."

太后乃下诏曰：“大司马新都侯莽三世为三公，典周公之职，建万世策，功德为忠臣宗，化流海内，远人慕义，越裳氏重译献白雉。
太后于是下诏说：“大司马新都侯王莽三代担任三公，履行周公的职责，建立万世国策，功德成为忠臣的表率，教化流传全国，远方的人仰慕道义，越裳氏辗转翻译进献白雉。
The [Grand] Empress Dowager thereupon issued an imperial edict, saying, "The Commander-in-chief, the Marquis of Hsin-tu, [Wang] Mang, has been one of the three highest ministers for three reigns and has performed the [same] duties [as those performed by] the Duke of Chou. He has established the plan [for the succession to the throne that is to endure for] ten thousand generations. In achievements and virtuous conduct he has been a model to palace officials. His influence has spread over [all] within the [four] seas, so that people of distant [regions] have thought with affection of right principles; a potentate of the Yüeh-shang, [whose speech must be] repeatedly interpreted [from one interpreter to another], presented a white pheasant as tribute.

其以召陵、新息二县户二万八千益封莽，复其后嗣，畴其爵邑，封功如萧相国。
现把召陵、新息两县的二万八千户加封给王莽，免除他后代的赋税徭役，他的爵位和封邑世代相传，按照萧何相国的先例封赏功勋。
"Let [Wang] Mang be additionally enfeoffed with [the income of] the twenty-eight thousand households in the two counties of Shao-ling and Hsin-hsi. His heirs who succeed him shall be exempted [from taxes and service] and their noble rank and estate shall be the same [as his]. His achievements shall be [ranked] the same as those of the [former] Chancellor of State, Hsiao [Ho.
莽为太傅，干四辅之事，号曰安汉公。
任命王莽为太傅，负责四辅的事务，封号为安汉公。
Wang] Mang shall be the Grand Tutor and in charge of the business of the Four Coadjutors. His title shall be the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty.

以故萧相国甲第为安汉公第，定著于令，传之无穷。”
把以前萧相国的上等宅第作为安汉公的宅第，在法令中明确规定，流传无穷。”
The first residence, that of the former Chancellor of State, Hsiao [Ho], shall become the residence of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty. Let [this ordinance] be established and published as a [permanent] ordinance and be transmitted [forever] without end."

于是莽为惶恐，不得已而起受策。
于是王莽感到惶恐，不得已才起身接受策命。
Thereupon [Wang] Mang hypocritically feared that he had no alternative and so he arose and received his charter [of appointment].

策曰：“汉危无嗣，公定国策，四辅之职，三公之任，而公干之；
策文说：“汉朝危难，没有继承人，您制定国策，四辅的职责，三公的重任，都由您承担；
The charter said, "The Han [dynasty] was in danger because there was no heir, and your excellency stabilized it. As to the positions of the Four Coadjutors and the responsibilities of the three highest ministers, your excellency controls them.

群僚众位，公卿大夫，咸取正焉。
百官各部门，公卿大夫，都由您统领。
As to the various officials and the many positions, your excellency rules them.

功德茂著，宗庙以安，盖白雉之瑞，周成象焉。
功德卓著，宗庙得以安宁，白雉的祥瑞，是周成王时代的景象再现。
Your merits and virtue are abundant and brilliant. Thereby the [imperial] ancestral temples are tranquil. Verily, the auspicious presage of the white pheasant is symbolical of [the way the Duke of] Chou [acted as minister to King] Ch'eng.

故赐嘉号曰安汉公，辅翼于帝，期于致平，毋违朕意。”
因此赐给您美好的称号为安汉公，辅佐皇帝，希望达到天下太平，不要违背我的旨意。”
Hence [We] grant you the auspicious title of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty. When you are the Coadjutor and protector of the Emperor, do you aim at bringing about [a condition of the utmost] tranquillity. Do not disappoint Our intentions."

莽受太傅安汉公号，让还益封畴爵邑事，云愿须百姓家给，然后加赏。
王莽接受太傅安汉公的称号，推辞退还增加的封邑和世代相传的爵位封邑，说希望等到百姓家家富足，然后再接受赏赐。
[Wang] Mang received the titles of Grand Tutor and Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [but] he yielded up and returned the matter of his increase in enfeoffment and his noble rank and estate being the same [for his descendants as for himself], saying, "I wish to wait until the people have a sufficiency in their households and then only should I be given any rewards."

群公复争，太后诏曰：“公自期百姓家给，是以听之。
大臣们又争辩，太后下诏说：“您希望等到百姓家家富足，因此听从您的意见。
The other highest ministers again argued with him. The [Grand] Empress Dowager's imperial edict said, "You, Duke, of your own accord aim at the people having a sufficiency in their households, because of which [We] listen to you.

其令公奉、舍人赏赐皆倍故。
命令您的俸禄、侍从的赏赐都比原来加倍。
Let it be ordered that your salary, Duke, and the rewards granted to the members of your suite shall all be double what they were previously.

百姓家给人足，大司徒、大司空以闻。”
等到百姓家家富足，大司徒、大司空上报。”
and when the people have a sufficiency in their households so that personally they have enough, the Grand Minister over the Multitude, [K'ung] Kuang, and the Grand Minister of Works, [Wang Ch'ung], shall report [the fact] in order that [you may thereupon be granted the full amount of your reward]."

莽复让不受，而建言宜立诸侯王后及高祖以来功臣子孙，大者封侯，或赐爵关内侯食邑，然后及诸在位，各有第序。
王莽又推辞不接受，而建议说应当封立诸侯王的后代以及高祖以来功臣的子孙，大的封侯，有的赐爵关内侯并给予食邑，然后轮到在职官员，各有等级次序。
[Wang] Mang again refused and would not receive [these honors] and proposed that it would be proper to set up descendants of the vassal kings [as kings] and to enfeoff the descendants of the more important of the meritorious courtiers of the Eminent Founder, [Emperor Kao], and his successors, as marquises or to grant them the noble rank of Marquis of the Imperial Domain with the income of estates; and thereafter those in office should each have his [full] rank, [so that there may be] a government making grants to every one, in which on the one hand, the [imperial] ancestral temples are honored by augmenting the rites and music [employed therein] and on the other hand, gentlemen and commoners are shown kindness and widowers and widows [are given] grace and bounty.

上尊宗庙，增加礼乐，下惠士民鳏寡，恩泽之政无所不施。
上可尊崇宗庙，增加礼乐制度，下可惠及士人百姓中的鳏寡之人，恩泽政策没有不施行的。
A discussion is in the "Annals of [Emperor Hsiao]-p'ing."

语在《平纪》。
这些事记载在《平帝纪》中。
When [Wang] Mang had pleased the mass of commoners, he also wanted the right to decide matters on his own authority.

莽既说众庶，又欲专断，知太后厌政，乃风公卿奏言：“往者，吏以功次迁至二千石，及州部所举茂材异等吏，率多不称，宜皆见安汉公。
王莽已经使百姓喜悦，又想独断专行，知道太后厌倦政事，于是暗示公卿上奏说：“过去，官吏按功绩依次升迁到二千石，以及州部所举荐的茂材等特殊人才，大多不称职，应当都拜见安汉公。
He knew that the [Grand] Empress Dowager had no taste for governing, so he gave a hint to the ministers. They memorialized her, saying, "In the past, officials have been promoted in accordance with the order of their merits to [positions ranking as] two thousand piculs. They, together with minor officials who have been recommended from the provincial divisions as being Abundant Talents of Unusual Degree, are for the most part not worthy [of their positions, so that] it would be proper that they should all interview the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang].

又太后不宜亲省小事。”
另外太后不应当亲自过问小事。”
It is also not proper that the [Grand] Empress Dowager should in person supervise unimportant matters."

令太后下诏曰：“皇帝幼年，朕且统政，比加元服。
让太后下诏说：“皇帝年幼，我暂且统理政事，等到皇帝加冠。
[Thus they] caused the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict which said, "Since the Emperor is young in years, We are temporarily directing the government until he puts on the bonnet of virility.

今众事烦碎，朕春秋高，精气不堪，殆非所以安躬体而育养皇帝者也。
如今各种事务繁琐细碎，我年纪已大，精力不能承受，恐怕这不是用来安养身体和培育皇帝的办法。
Now most matters are complicated and detailed, while Our years are many and [Our] bodily vigor is insufficient. [If We attend to these matters], there is danger that [We] may not have the means of keeping [Our] body in health or of caring for the Emperor.

故选用忠贤，立四辅，群下劝职，永以康宁。
因此选用忠诚贤能之人，设立四辅，百官努力尽职，永久安康。
Hence [We] have selected loyal and capable persons and have set up the Four Coadjutors, so that [Our] many inferiors should be urged to do their duty and there should perpetually be prosperity and peace.

孔子曰：‘巍巍乎，舜禹之有天下而不与焉！’
孔子说：‘多么崇高啊，舜、禹拥有天下却不亲自处理政务！’
"Confucius `said, "How sublime the way Shun and Yü held possession of the country and yet remained indifferent to [the details of government]!" '

自今以来，惟封爵乃以闻，他事，安汉公、四辅平决。
从今以后，只有封爵之事才上报，其他事务，由安汉公、四辅裁决。
From this time and henceforth, except for enfeoffments of noble titles, which shall nevertheless be reported [to Us], in all other matters, the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty and the Four Coadjutors shall judge and decide.

州牧、二千石及茂材吏初除奏事者，辄引入至近署对安汉公，考故官，问新职，以知其称否。”
州牧、二千石以及初次任命的茂材吏上奏事务的，就引领到近署拜见安汉公，考察过去的官职表现，询问新职位的职责，以了解他们是否称职。”
As to Provincial Shepherds, [officials ranking at] two thousand piculs, together with minor officials [who are recommended as being] Abundant Talents, when they are [considered] for their first appointment [to office] and when they memorialize matters, they shall each time be led into an office near [the palace] to answer questions; the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], shall examine into their former offices and ask about their new duties, in order that he may know whether they are worthy or not."

于是莽人人延问，致密恩意，厚加赠送，其不合指，显奏免之，权与人主侔矣。
于是王莽一一接见询问，表达深切的恩意，丰厚地加以赠送，对那些不合心意的，就公开上奏罢免他们，权力与君主相等了。
Thereupon [Wang] Mang received and questioned each one [of the officials], conveyed to them his secret gracious intentions, and bestowed upon them rich parting gifts, while he brought out memorials concerning those who did not suit his purposes and dismissed them, so that his power was equal to that of the lord of men.

莽欲以虚名说太后，白言“亲承前孝哀丁、傅奢侈之后，百姓未赡者多，太后宜且衣缯练，颇损膳，以视天下。”
王莽想用虚名取悦太后，禀告说“亲自承接前代孝哀皇帝时丁、傅两家奢侈之后，百姓不富足的很多，太后应当暂且穿粗帛衣服，略微减少膳食，以昭示天下。”
[Wang] Mang wanted to delight the [Grand] Empress Dowager with vain reputation, so advised her in conversation that since she had herself succeeded to the extravagance of the Ting and Fu [clans related to] the deceased [Emperor] Hsiao-ai, while most of the people did not have enough [to live on], it would be proper for the [Grand] Empress Dowager temporarily to wear coarse plain silk, and to reduce considerably [the expense of] her cuisine, in order to show [her economical spirit] to the empire.

莽因上书，愿出钱百万，献田三十顷，付大司农助给贫民。
王莽趁机上书，愿意献出一百万钱，三十顷田，交付大司农来资助贫民。
[Wang] Mang thereupon presented a letter, stating that he would pay a million cash and offer thirty ch'ing of cultivated fields, to be paid to the Grand Minister of Agriculture, for assistance and gifts to the poor people.

于是公卿皆慕效焉。
于是公卿都羡慕效仿他。
Thereupon the ministers all admired and imitated him.

莽帅群臣上奏曰：“陛下春秋尊，久衣重练，减御膳，诚非所以辅精气，育皇帝，安宗庙也。
王莽率领群臣上奏说：“陛下年纪尊贵，长期穿厚粗帛，减少膳食，实在不是用来辅助精气，养育皇帝，安定宗庙的办法。
[Wang] Mang led the various courtiers in a memorial, saying, "Your Majesty is of an honorable age, [yet] you have for a long time worn heavy plain white silk and have reduced your imperial cuisine, which verily is not the way to sustain your bodily vigor, to care for the Emperor, or to give tranquillity to the [imperial] ancestral temples.

臣莽数叩头省户下，白争未见许。
臣王莽多次在宫中省部门下叩头，禀告力争，未蒙允准。
Your servant Mang has several times knocked his head to the ground at the door to your Inner Apartments and has advised and argued with you [concerning this practise, but my request that this practise be discontinued] has not yet been approved.

今幸赖陛下德泽，间者风雨时，甘露降，神芝生，蓂荚、朱草、嘉禾、休征同时并至。
现在幸赖陛下的德泽，近来风雨及时，甘露降下，神芝生长，蓂荚、朱草、嘉禾、吉祥的征兆同时都出现了。
Now, thanks to your Majesty's virtue and beneficence, the wind and rain have recently been timely, sweet dew has descended, the supernatural fungus of immortality has grown, the calendar plant and the red herb, auspicious cereals and [other] favorable signs have all appeared simultaneously.

臣莽等不胜大愿，愿陛下爱精休神，阔略思虑，遵帝王之常服，复太官之法膳，使臣子各得尽欢心，备共养。
臣王莽等人不胜最大的愿望，希望陛下爱惜精神，休养心神，放宽思虑，遵循帝王的常规服饰，恢复太官的法定膳食，使臣子们各自能尽到欢心，备办供奉之物。
Your servant Mang and the others are not capable of overcoming their great hopes: we wish that your Majesty would have compassion upon your energy, rest your spirit, relax your thoughts, conform to the regular imperial robes, and restore the legal cuisine of the Grand Provisioner, thereby causing each of your subjects and children to be completely content in his heart and to supply your needs perfectly.

惟哀省察！”
希望您哀怜省察！”
We hope that you will sympathetically scrutinize [our request]."

莽又令太后下诏曰：“盖闻母后之义，思不出乎门阈。
王莽又让太后下诏说：“听说母后的道理，心思不超出宫门的界限。
[Wang] Mang also caused the [Grand] Empress Dowager to issue an imperial edict which said, "Verily, [We] have heard that [according to] the moral principles for the mother of a ruler, her thoughts should not go outside the threshold of the door.

国不蒙佑，皇帝年在襁褓，未任亲政，战战兢兢，惧于宗庙之不安。
国家不蒙上天保佑，皇帝在襁褓之中，不能亲自执政，我战战兢兢，担心宗庙不安。
Since the state has not received [Heaven's] blessing and the Emperor is of the age when he is in swaddling-clothes and is not yet capable of governing in person, [We] have trembled with apprehension and [guarded Ourself] for fear that the [imperial] ancestral temples would not be tranquil.

国家之大纲，微朕孰当统之？
国家的大纲，没有我谁来统领？
Except for Us, who can control the general policies of the state?

是以孔子见南子，周公居摄，盖权时也。
因此孔子进见南子，周公摄政，大概是权衡时势。
"It was for such reasons that Confucius interviewed Nan-tzu and that the Duke of Chou acted as regent, which was probably an expedient suited to the time.

勤身极思，忧劳未绥，故国奢则视之以俭，矫枉者过其正，而朕不身帅，将谓天下何！
我勤身极思，忧虑劳苦没有安宁，所以国家奢侈就用俭朴来显示，纠正偏差要超过正常，而我不亲自带头，天下人会怎么说！
[We] have fatigued [Ourself] and have pondered to the utmost [degree], have toiled and worried, and have not yet become tranquil. Hence `if the state is prodigal, then [a sage] gives it an example of economy,' and `in straightening a curved [piece of wood, it may be spoiled by being bent backwards] beyond a straight [line,' so We may have gone too far in economizing], yet if We do not personally lead [the empire back to correctness], what will [We be able] to say to the empire?

夙夜梦想，五谷丰熟，百姓家给，比皇帝加元服，委政而授焉。
日夜梦想，五谷丰登，百姓家家富足，等到皇帝加冠，把政权委托给他。
[We] have hoped morning and night that the five [kinds of] grains should be harvested in abundance and the peoples' households should have a sufficiency. When the Emperor dons the cap of virility, [We] shall entrust the government to him and transfer it to him.

今诚未皇于轻靡而备味，庶几与百僚有成，其勖之哉！”
现在实在无暇顾及轻靡的服饰和丰盛的美味，希望与百官有所成就，大家要努力啊！”
[We] now verily have had no leisure for light and delicate [clothing] or for perfectly flavored [food] and hope that together with the many officials [We] may achieve [a good government]. Let [us all] make [great] efforts towards this [end]."

每有水旱，莽辄素食，左右以白。
每当有水灾旱灾，王莽就吃素食，左右的人把这事报告上去。
Every time there was a flood or drought, [Wang] Mang would eat plain food. When her entourage advised her of it,

太后遣使者诏莽曰：“闻公菜食，忧民深矣。
太后派遣使者诏令王莽说：“听说您吃素食，忧虑百姓太深切了。
the [Grand] Empress Dowager sent a messenger with an imperial edict to [Wang] Mang, saying, "[We] have heard that you, Duke, have been eating [only] vegetables. Your solicitude for the common people is indeed deep.

今秋幸熟，公勤于职，以时食肉，爱身为国。”
今年秋天幸好丰收，您勤于职守，按时吃肉，为国家爱护身体。”
Since in this autumn there has fortunately been a good harvest, and you, Duke, are so diligent in your duties, at this time you should eat meat and care for your body for the sake of the state."


莽念中国已平，唯四夷未有异，乃遣使者赍黄金、币、帛，重赂匈奴单于，使上书言：“闻中国讥二名，故名囊知牙斯今更名知，慕从圣制。”
王莽考虑中原已经平定，只有四方夷族没有变化，于是派遣使者携带黄金、钱币、丝帛，丰厚地贿赂匈奴单于，让他上书说：“听说中原讥讽双名，所以我的名字囊知牙斯现在改名为知，仰慕遵从圣朝制度。”
[Wang] Mang pondered that the Middle States were already tranquil, and only the barbarians of the four [quarters] were still the same as [before]. So he sent an envoy to give actual gold and valuable silks, as heavy bribes, to the Hun Shan-yü, in order to have him send a letter to the Emperor, which said, "I have heard that in the Middle States a double personal name is criticized. My former personal name has been Nang-chih-ya-szu. Now I change my personal name to Chih, in admiration of and conformity to the regulations of the sages."

又遣王昭君女须卜居次入待。
又派遣王昭君的女儿须卜居次进宫侍奉。
He also sent [Lüan-ti Yün], the Hun Princess [who had married] Hsü-pu [Tang] and who was the daughter of Wang [Ch'iang] Chao-chün, to enter [the court] and wait upon [the Grand Empress Dowager.

所以诳耀媚事太后，下至旁侧长御，方故万端。
用来欺骗炫耀、献媚侍奉太后的手段，下至太后身边的侍从，方法多种多样。
[Wang Mang thus used] myriads of methods and stratagems to dazzle deceptively and serve flatteringly the [Grand] Empress Dowager and her inferiors down to her Chief Chamberlain who was at her side.

莽既尊重，欲以女配帝为皇后，以固其权，奏言：“皇帝即位三年，长秋宫未建，液廷媵未充。
王莽地位既已尊贵，想把女儿许配给皇帝做皇后，以巩固自己的权力，上奏说：“皇帝即位三年，皇后之位尚未确立，后宫嫔妃也未齐备。
[Wang] Mang had become an important personage, he wanted to mate his daughter to the Emperor, making her the Empress, in order to make his power secure. [So] he memorialized, saying, "The Emperor has been on the throne to the third year, [yet the occupant of] the Ch'ang-ch'iu Palace, [the Empress], has not yet been established and [the positions of] concubines in the Lateral Courts have not yet been filled.

乃者，国家之难，本从亡嗣，配取不正。
从前，国家的危难，根源在于没有继承人，婚配不当。
Anciently, the difficulties of the dynasty have originated from heirs being lacking and from [imperial] marriages and takings [of concubines] having been incorrect.

请考论《五经》，定取礼，正十二女之义，以广继嗣。
请求考察讨论《五经》，制定嫁娶的礼仪，明确选取十二女的道理，以增加继承人。
I beg that the Five Classics be investigated and discussed in order to establish rites for [the imperial] marriage and to fix the principle of [the Emperor's] twelve women, in order to increase his posterity.

博采二王后及周公、孔子世列侯在长安者適子女。
广泛选取夏、商二王的后代以及在长安的周公、孔子后代中的列侯嫡女。
and a wide selection [for his harem] from the daughters of the principal wives of the descendants from the two [immediately preceding dynasties of true] kings, [the Shang and Chou dynasties], the posterity of the Duke of Chou and of Confucius, and the marquises in Ch'ang-an.

事下有司，上众女名，王氏女多在选中者。
这件事交给有关部门办理，上报众多女子的名单，王氏家族的女子多在被选中的人当中。
The matter was referred to the high officials and they presented [to the Grand Empress Dowager] the names of a multitude of girls. The girls of the Wang clan were the most numerous of those selected [as candidates for becoming the Empress.

莽恐其与己女争，即上言：“身亡德，子材下，不宜与众女并采。”
王莽担心她们和自己的女儿竞争，就上奏说：“我自身没有德行，女儿的才能低下，不适合和众多女子一起被选取。”
Wang Mang feared that they would compete with his own daughter, so he immediately presented [a letter] saying,"I personally am without virtue and my child's abilities are of a low [order], so that it would not be proper for her to be put with the multitude of girls [from whom the Empress] is to be chosen."

太后以为至诚，乃下诏曰：“王氏女，朕之外家，其勿采。”
太后认为他非常真诚，就下诏书说：“王氏家族的女子，是我的娘家人，不要选取她们。”
The [Grand] Empress Dowager thought that he was completely sincere, so issued an imperial edict [for the Emperor], saying, "The girls of the Wang clan are Our maternal relatives. Let them not be selected [for the imperial harem]."

庶民、诸生、郎吏以上守阙上书者日千余人，公卿大夫或诣廷中，或伏省户下，咸言：
平民、儒生、郎官以上官员守候在宫门前上书的每天有一千多人，公卿大夫有的到朝廷中，有的伏在宫署门下，都说：
The many common people, the [Confucian] masters, the Gentlemen, the lower officials, and [those holding] higher positions, who [thereupon came to] wait at the [Palace] Portals to present letters [to the Grand Empress Dowager, numbered] more than a thousand daily; some of the ministers and grandees went to the middle of the [principal] court and some prostrated themselves outside the doors of the Inner [Apartments]. All said,

“明诏圣德巍巍如彼，安汉公盛勋堂堂若此，今当立后，独奈何废公女？天下安所归命！愿得公女为天下母。”
“英明诏令所体现的圣德如此崇高，安汉公的盛大功勋如此显著，现在应当确立皇后，为什么偏偏要废弃安汉公的女儿呢？天下人的心将归向何处！希望能让安汉公的女儿做天下人的母亲。”
"The sage virtue of your enlightened edict is as sublime as" that, [or] "The abundant and glorious services of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty are as magnificent as" this, [or], "Now that an Empress is to be established, why should the daughter of the Duke be specially excluded? Where would the destiny of the empire be [better] placed? We wish to secure the daughter of the Duke as the mother of the empire."

莽遣长安以下分部晓止公卿及诸生，而上书者愈甚。
王莽派长安令以下官员分别去劝说公卿和儒生停止上书，可是上书的人更多了。
[Wang] Mang sent his Chief Clerk and subordinates by divisions to instruct and stop the ministers and the [Confucian] masters, but those who presented letters [to the Grand Empress Dowager] were even greater [in number than before,

太后不得已，听公卿采莽女。
太后迫不得已，听从公卿的意见选取王莽的女儿。
so the Grand] Empress Dowager had no alternative but to listen to the ministers and select the daughter of Wang] Mang [to be the Empress].

莽复自白：“宜博选众女。”
王莽又自己表白说：“应该广泛选取众多女子。”
[When Wang] Mang again himself advised her that it would be proper to select widely from among the host of [suitable] girls,

公卿争曰：“不宜采诸女以贰正统。”
公卿们争辩说：“不应该选取其他女子而使正统的地位出现二心。”
the ministers contested with him, saying, "It is not proper to select other girls and thereby alter the proper line of succession, [which can only come through the daughter of the Duke]."

莽白：“愿见女。”
王莽说：“希望让我的女儿出来见见。”
[Wang] Mang [accordingly] advised [the Grand Empress Dowager] that he was willing to have his daughter interviewed.

太后遣长乐少府、宗正、尚书令纳采见女，还奏言：
太后派长乐少府、宗正、尚书令备礼去相看王莽的女儿，回来后上奏说：
The [Grand] Empress Dowager sent the Privy Treasurer of Ch'ang-lo [Palace, Hsia-hou Fan], the Superintendent of the Imperial House, [Liu Hung], and the Prefect of the Masters of Writing, [P'ing Yen], to present the proposal [of marriage] and to interview the girl. They returned and memorialized, saying,

“公女渐渍德化，有窈窕之容，宜承天序，奉祭祀。”
“安汉公的女儿受到道德教化的熏陶，有美好的容貌，适合继承天命，侍奉祭祀。”
"The daughter of the Duke has been imbued with virtue and culture and has a beautiful and fascinating appearance, so that it would be proper for her to continue the heavenly succession and uphold the [imperial] sacrifices."

有诏遣大司徒、大司空策告宗庙，杂加卜筮，皆曰：
诏令派遣大司徒、大司空拿着策书去祭告宗庙，又用多种方式进行占卜，都说：
There was an imperial edict sending the Grand Master Over the Masses, [Ma Kung], and the Grand Minister of Works, [Chen Feng], to inform in an official document [the imperial ancestors in the imperial] ancestral temples and in various ways to perform divination by the tortoise-shell and by the stalks. They reported unanimously,

“兆遇金水王相，封遇父母得位，所谓‘康强’之占，‘逢吉’之符也。”
“占卜得到金水相生的吉兆，卦象显示父母得位，这就是所说的‘安康强健’的占卜结果，‘遇到吉祥’的符兆。”
"The cracks upon the tortoise-shell which occurred were [a prognostic] that metal and water will flourish and assist. The diagram formed by the stalks which occurred was that the father and mother will occupy [their due] positions, which may be said to be a response [presaging] prosperity and security, a portent of great good fortune."

信乡侯佟上言：“《春秋》，天子将娶于纪，则褒纪子称侯，安汉公国未称古制。
信乡侯刘佟上奏说：“《春秋》记载，天子将要从纪国娶亲，就褒奖纪国国君，称他为侯，安汉公的封国不符合古代制度。”
The Marquis of Hsin-hsiang, [Liu] T'ung, presented [to the throne a memorial], saying, "[According to] the Spring and Autumn, when the Son of Heaven was about to take [a bride from the state of] Chi, he rewarded the Viscount of Chi with the title of Marquis. The estate of the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang Mang], is not yet conformable to [this] ancient regulation."

事下有司，皆曰：“古者天子封后父百里，尊而不臣，以重宗庙，孝之至也。
这件事交给有关部门，他们都说：“古代天子封皇后的父亲方圆百里的土地，尊重他而不把他当作臣子，以此重视宗庙，这是最大的孝道。
The matter was referred to the high officials, and all advised, "Anciently, the Son of Heaven enfeoffed the father of his Empress [with a fief] a hundred li [square]; he honored [his father-in-law] and did not treat him as his subject, in order to give importance to his ancestral temple. It was the extreme of filial piety.

佟言应礼，可许。请以新野田二万五千六百顷益封莽，满百里。”
刘佟的话符合礼制，可以批准。请求把新野县二万五千六百顷田地加封给王莽，使他的封国满百里。”
[Liu] T'ung's advice is in conformity with the rites and may be approved. We beg that [Wang] Mang be additionally enfeoffed with the 25,600 ch'ing of cultivated fields in [the county of] Hsin-yeh, [in order that he may have] a full hundred li."

莽谢曰：“臣莽子女诚不足以配至尊，复听众议，益封臣莽。
王莽辞谢说：“我的女儿确实不配匹配最尊贵的人，又听从大家的意见，加封我的土地。
[Wang] Mang excused himself, saying, "Your subject Mang's daughter is really not fit to be mated to the most honorable person [i.e., the Emperor]. I furthermore have heard about the discussions of the many [officials concerning] an increase in my enfeoffment.

伏自惟念，得托肺腑，获爵士，如使子女诚能奉称圣德，臣莽国邑足以共朝贡，不须复加益地之宠。
我暗自思量，得以托身于皇室亲属之中，获得爵位和土地，如果我的女儿真能胜任奉承圣德，我的封国食邑足够供给朝贡之物，不需要再增加土地的恩宠。
I, your subject Mang, myself humbly meditate that I have been permitted to rely upon [the fact that I am] a distant relative [of the throne] and have [thus] attained noble rank and lands. If my daughter is really capable of supporting and according with your sage virtue, the estate of your subject Mang is [yet] sufficient to make offerings for the tribute at the court; it is not necessary again to give me the favor of added territory.

愿归所益。”太后许之。
希望归还所增加的土地。”太后批准了。
I wish to return what was to be added." The [Grand] Empress Dowager approved it.

有司奏：“故事，聘皇后黄金二万斤，为钱二万万。”
有关部门上奏说：“按照旧例，聘娶皇后用黄金二万斤，折合钱二万万。”
The high officials memorialized that, [according to] ancient practises, an empress was betrothed [with a gift of] twenty thousand catties of actual gold, which would be two hundred million cash.

莽深辞让，受四千万，而以其三千三百万予十一媵家。
王莽极力辞让，接受了四千万，而把其中的三千三百万给予了十一位陪嫁女子的家庭。
[Wang] Mang declined it and asked strongly that it be given to others, [but] received forty million [cash] and gave thirty-three million [cash] of that [sum] to the families of [the Emperor's] eleven concubines, [who were to accompany the Empress].

群臣复言：“今皇后受骋，逾群妾亡几。”
群臣又说：“现在皇后接受的聘礼，比各位姬妾多不了多少。”
Various courtiers again said, "Now the betrothal presents received for the Empress barely surpass those for the various concubines."

有诏，复益二千三百万，合为三千万。
于是下诏书，再增加二千三百万，合计为三千万。
[So] there was an imperial edict again increasing [the gift to Wang Mang] by twenty-three million [cash, making it] altogether thirty million [cash.

莽复以其千万分予九族贫者。
王莽又把其中的一千万分给了九族中的贫苦人家。
Wang] Mang again used ten million [cash] of that [sum] to divide among the poor persons in his nine [sets of] relatives.

陈崇时为大司徒司直，与张敞孙竦相善。
陈崇当时担任大司徒司直，和张敞的孙子张竦关系友好。
Ch'en Ch'ung was at that time Director of Justice to the Grand Minister over the Masses, [Ma Kung], and was good friends with Chang Ch'ang's grandson, [Chang] Sung.

竦者博通士，为崇草奏，称莽功德，崇奏之，曰：
张竦是个博学通达的人，替陈崇起草奏章，称颂王莽的功德，陈崇上奏了这份奏章，说：
[Chang] Sung was a gentlemen of wide learning, and drafted for [Ch'en] Ch'ung a memorial praising the achievements and virtuous conduct of [Wang] Mang, which [Ch'en] Ch'ung memorialized. It said,

窃见安汉公自初束脩，值世俗隆奢丽之时，蒙两宫厚骨肉之宠，被诸父赫赫之光，财饶势足，亡所牾意，
我私下看到安汉公从刚开始求学时起，正赶上社会风气崇尚奢侈华丽的时代，承蒙成帝和太后厚待亲属的恩宠，蒙受各位叔父显赫的荣光，财产富足，权势很大，没有什么事情不顺心，
"[According to] the opinion of your unworthy servant, from the time that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty first `brought his bundle of dried flesh [and began studying],' he has been placed in an age when customs have been highly extravagant and luxurious, has had the high favor of being allied in flesh and blood to [the occupants of] two palaces, [Emperor Ch'eng and the Grand Empress Dowager nee Wang], and has been covered with the illustrious brilliance of his various uncles. His wealth has been great and his power abundant, so that his will was unopposed.

然而折节行仁，克心履礼，拂世矫俗，确然特立；
然而他降低身份施行仁爱，克制自己遵守礼仪，违背世俗矫正风气，坚定地特立独行；
Yet he has humbled himself, lived a life of kindness and goodness, vanquished his desires, and walked in the path of proper conduct, resisting the age and correcting its customs, standing firmly alone,

恶衣恶食，陋车驽马，妃匹无二，闺门之内，孝友之德，众莫不闻；
穿粗劣的衣服，吃粗淡的食物，乘坐简陋的车子，使用劣等的马匹，配偶没有第二个，家门之内，孝顺友爱的品德，众人没有不知道的；
[wearing] poor clothes and [eating] poor food, with a shabby carriage and sorry horses, with one consort and no other [woman]. No one of the multitude has failed to hear of [the wonderful conditions] within the doors of his inner apartments and of his virtues of filial piety and friendliness.

清静乐道，温良下士，惠于故旧，笃于师友。
清心寡欲，乐于正道，温和善良，谦恭地对待士人，对老朋友有恩惠，对老师朋友很忠厚。
He is quiescent, rejoicing in the Way, gentle and good, and associating with worthy inferiors. He is kindly to his old friends and servitors and faithful to his teachers and associates.

孔子曰：“未若贫而乐，富而好礼”，公之谓矣。
孔子说：“不如贫穷却快乐，富有却爱好礼仪”，说的就是安汉公啊。
Confucius said, `No [one] is as good as the man who is poor and yet happy, rich and yet loves the rules of proper conduct,' which indeed applies to the Duke."

及为侍中，故定陵侯淳于长有大逆罪，公不敢私，建白诛讨。
到担任侍中时，原定陵侯淳于长犯有大逆不道的罪行，安汉公不敢徇私情，建议诛杀讨伐他。
"When he was a Palace Attendant and the former Marquis of Ting-ling, Shun-yü Chang, committed the crime of treason, the Duke did not presume to keep it to himself [but] advocated that [his cousin] should be punished.

周公诛管、蔡，季子鸩叔牙，公之谓矣。
周公诛杀管叔、蔡叔，季子用毒酒杀死叔牙，说的就是安汉公啊。
The Duke of Chou executed [the King's Uncles] of Kuan and of Ts'ai and Master Chi [Yu] poisoned Shu Ya, which [precedent] indeed denotes that the Duke [is like these sages]."

是以孝成皇帝命公大司马，委以国统。
因此孝成皇帝任命安汉公为大司马，把国家的统治大权委托给他。
"For this reason, Emperor Hsiao-ch'eng gave the Duke a mandate to be his Commander-in-chief, entrusting him with the government of the state."

孝哀皇帝即位，骄妾窥欲，奸臣萌动，公手劾高昌侯董宏，改正故定陶共王母之僣坐。
孝哀皇帝即位后，骄横的妃妾觊觎（太后之位），奸臣开始活动，安汉公亲手弹劾高昌侯董宏，纠正了原定陶共王母亲（超越本分的）僭越座位。
"When [Emperor] Hsiao-ai ascended the throne, while the proud concubine, [the Queen Dowager nee Fu] watched him furtively [for a chance] to work her will and while his wicked courtiers hatched rebellion, you, Duke, yourself impeached the Marquis of Kao-ch'ang, Tung Hung, and [at an imperial banquet] changed and corrected the usurped seat of the now deceased [Queen Dowager nee Fu], the mother of King Kung of Ting-t'ao, [Liu K'ang]."

自是之后，朝臣论议，靡不据经。
从此以后，朝廷大臣讨论议事，没有不依据经典的。
"From that time on, when the officials of the court discussed [matters], no one failed to accord with the Classics."

以病辞位，归于第家，为贼臣所陷。
（安汉公）因病辞去职位，回到自己的府第，被奸贼陷害。
"He took leave of his position on account of illness and returned to his great house, where he was endangered by brigand-like officials."

就国之后，孝哀皇帝觉寤，复还公长安，临病加剧，犹不忘公，复特进位。
到封国之后，孝哀皇帝醒悟，又把安汉公召回长安，（皇帝）病重加剧时，仍然没有忘记安汉公，又特意提升他的职位。
"After he had gone to his estate, Emperor Hsiao-ai awakened [to a comprehension of his error] and again returned you, Duke, to Ch'ang-an. When he became ill and [his illness] became increasingly severe, he still did not forget you, Duke, and again especially advanced your rank."

是夜仓卒，国无储主，奸臣充朝，危殆甚矣。
当晚局势仓促，国家没有皇位继承人，奸臣充斥朝廷，危险到了极点。
"That night, in [a time of] haste and confusion, the state was without a presumptive heir and wicked courtiers filled the court, so that the peril was indeed great."

朕惟定国之计莫宜于公，引纳于朝，即日罢退高安侯董贤，转漏之间，忠策辄建，纲纪咸张。
我考虑安定国家的计策没有比安汉公更合适的，把您召进朝廷，当天就罢免斥退了高安侯董贤，顷刻之间，忠诚的计策就制定出来，国家纲纪都得以确立。
"We reflected that no one was more fitting than you, Duke, [to make] a plan for giving tranquillity to the state, [so We] had you inducted into the court. That same day [We] dismissed the Marquis of Kao-an, Tung Hsien, and within the interval of a turn of the clepsydra, your loyal plans were immediately established and the main and subordinate [dynastic] principles were all set forth in detail."

"Because Emperor Hsiao-p'ing was young, We temporarily took charge of the government of the state. [We] hoped to put upon him the cap of maturity and to entrust the government to him and hand it over."

今短命而崩，呜呼哀哉！
现在他短命去世，呜呼哀哉！
"But now his life has been cut short and he is dead. Alas! How sad!"

已使有司征孝宣皇帝玄孙二十三人，差度宜者，以嗣孝平皇帝之后。
已经命令有关部门征召孝宣皇帝的二十三位玄孙，挑选合适的人，来继承孝平皇帝的后代。
"[We] have already had the high officials summon twenty-three great-great-grandsons of Emperor Hsiao-hsüan, to choose an appropriate person to be the heir and successor of Emperor Hsiao-p'ing."

玄孙年在襁褓，不得至德君子，孰能安之？
玄孙还在襁褓之中，如果没有极有德行的君子，谁能安定他？
"This great-great-grandson is of the age when he is in swaddling clothes; if [We] are not able to secure [to be his regent] a princely man who has reached the very heart of virtue, who can give tranquillity to [the empire]?"

安汉公莽辅政三世，比遭际会，安光汉室，遂同殊风，至于制作，与周公异世同符。
安汉公王莽辅佐朝政三代，屡次遭遇机会，安定光大汉朝，使不同风俗的人都能统一，至于制礼作乐，与周公在不同时代却有相同的符命。
"The Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang] Mang, has assisted in the government for three reigns, has repeatedly met with critical times, has tranquillized and made brilliant the House of Han, and has thereupon made [people] of customs differing [from those of the Chinese become] like [the Chinese even] in their institutions, [so that] he has had the same presages as those had at a different age by the Duke of Chou."

今前辉光嚣、武功长通上言丹石之符，朕深思厥意，云‘为皇帝’者，乃摄行皇帝之事也。
现在前辉光谢嚣、武功县长孟通上报丹石的符命，我深思其中的意思，说‘为皇帝’，是指代理行使皇帝的职权。
"Now the Displayer of Splendor in the South, [Hsieh] Hsiao, and the Chief of Wu-kung [prefecture, Meng] T'ung, have presented [a memorial] speaking of a red stone portent. We have thought profoundly that its meaning, which said, `[Wang Mang] should become Emperor,' is however that as Regent he should perform the duties of the Emperor."

夫有法成易，非圣人者亡法。
有了法度就容易成功，不是圣人就没有法度。
"Verily if there is a model, accomplishment is easy; [but] if there is no sage, there is no model."

其令安汉公居摄践祚，如周公故事，以武功县为安汉公采地，名曰汉光邑。
命令安汉公登上皇位代理朝政，像周公的旧例一样，把武功县作为安汉公的采地，命名为汉光邑。
"Let it be ordered that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should occupy [the post of] Regent and should [be permitted to] mount the eastern [master's] steps [at the altar to Heaven], as in the former case [was done by] the Duke of Chou. Let the prefecture of Wu-kung become the territory whose revenue is allocated to the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, and let its name be the town of Han-kuang (the Han [dynasty's] brilliance)."

具礼仪奏。”
准备好礼仪奏上。”
"Let there be prepared a memorial concerning the ceremonial [for the above]."

于是群臣奏言：“太后圣德昭然，深见天意，诏令安汉公居摄。
于是群臣上奏说：“太后圣德明显，深刻洞察天意，诏令安汉公代理朝政。
"Thereupon the various courtiers memorialized, saying, "The sage virtue of the [Grand] Empress Dowager is brilliant. You have seen deeply into the intentions of Heaven and have issued an imperial order that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should act as Regent."

臣闻周成王幼少，周道未成，成王不能共事天地，修文、武之烈。
我们听说周成王年幼，周朝的治国之道尚未完成，成王不能恭敬地侍奉天地，继承文王、武王的功业。
"Your subjects have heard that when King Ch'eng of the Chou [dynasty] was a minor and the practises of the Chou [dynasty] had not yet been completed, so that King Ch'eng was unable to perform his duties to Heaven and Earth and to renew the illustrious services [performed by Kings] Wen and Wu,"

周公权而居摄，则周道成，王室安；不居摄，则恐周队失天命。
周公权衡形势而代理朝政，于是周朝的治国之道得以完成，王室安定；不代理朝政，就恐怕周朝会坠落而失去天命。
"the Duke of Chou temporarily acted as Regent and the practises of the Chou [dynasty] were therefore completed and its kingly house was at peace. If he had not acted as Regent, then it is to be feared that the Chou [dynasty] would have lost the mandate of Heaven."

《书》曰：‘我嗣事子孙，大不克共上下，遏失前人光，在家不知命不易。天应棐谌，乃亡队命。’
《尚书》说：‘我们继承事业的子孙，很不能恭敬地侍奉天地，断绝失去前人的荣光，在诸侯家不知道天命的艰难。上天应辅助诚信的人，才不会失去天命。’
"The Book of History [quotes the Duke of Chou as] saying [to Prince Shih, the Duke of Shao], `If the son or grandson who becomes the heir to and serves our [lord, King Wu], should be altogether incapable of reverencing [the deities] above and below, [Heaven, Earth, the ancestors, and gods], and lose the glory of his predecessors, if we [were retired, living] at home, we would remain ignorant of it. The Mandate [of Heaven] is not easy [to retain], and the assistance of Heaven is not sure, so that His mandate may be lost.'"

说曰：周公服天子之冕，南面而朝群臣，发号施令，常称王命。
解释说：周公戴着天子的礼帽，面向南接见群臣，发号施令，常常称是周王的命令。
"The explanation says, `The Duke of Chou wore the tasselled mortar-board bonnet of the Son of Heaven, faced south and held audience for the courtiers, and made proclamations and gave ordinances, constantly calling them the mandates of the King.'"

召公贤人，不知圣人之意，故不说也。
召公是贤人，不了解圣人的心意，所以不高兴。
"The Duke of Shao was a worthy person, [but] did not understand the intentions of the sage, [the Duke of Chou], hence was not pleased.'"

《礼·明堂记》曰‘周公朝诸侯于明堂，天子负斧依南面而立。’
《礼记·明堂记》说‘周公在明堂接见诸侯，像天子一样，背靠画有斧形花纹的屏风面向南站立。’
"The [Record of] Proprieties (Li[chi]), in `Record of the Ming-t'ang,' says, `When the Duke of Chou held court for the nobles in the Ming-t'ang, [like] the Son of Heaven, he turned his back to the axe-embroidered screen, faced south, and stood up.'"

谓‘周公践天子位，六年朝诸侯，制礼作乐，而天下大服’也。
说的是‘周公登上天子之位，六年接见诸侯，制定礼制，创作乐教，天下人都非常信服’。
"It means that the Duke of Chou occupied the throne of the Son of Heaven to the sixth year, held court for the nobles, established the rites, and composed the music, so that the empire submitted widely."

召公不说。时武王崩，■粗未除。
召公不高兴。当时武王刚去世，粗麻丧服还没有除去。
"[But] the Duke of Shao was not pleased. At that time, King Wu had [just] died and the coarse mourning garments had not yet been put off."

由是言之，周公始摄则居天了之位，非乃六年而践阼也。
由此说来，周公开始代理朝政时就居于天子之位，不是到六年才登上王位。
"From this way of considering it, when the Duke of Chou first became Regent, he then occupied the Son of Heaven's throne and it was not [that he waited] until the sixth year [before] he mounted the eastern steps."

《书》逸《嘉禾篇》曰：‘周公奉鬯立于阼阶，延登，赞曰：假王莅政，勤和天下。’
《尚书》失传的《嘉禾篇》说：‘周公捧着香酒站在东阶上，迎接诸侯登上台阶，赞辞说：代理国王临朝理政，努力使天下和谐。’
"The lost chapter of the Book of History, `Auspicious Grain,' says, `When the Duke of Chou offered the herb-flavored millet liquor, he stood upon the steps of the eastern staircase and was conducted to mount them, and the presentation speech [at the offering] said, "The Acting King is ruling over the government and diligently harmonizing the world."'"

此周公摄政，赞者所称。
这是周公代理朝政时，赞礼的人所称呼的。
"The [foregoing] is how the Duke of Chou was entitled by the person [who read] the presentation speech when [the Duke of Chou] was regent in the government."

成王加元服，周公则致政。
周成王成年加冠后，周公就归还政权。
"When King Ch'eng put on his cap of maturity, the Duke of Chou thereupon presented the government to him."

《书》曰：‘朕复子明辟’，周公常称王命，专行不报，故言我复子明君也。
《尚书》说：‘我把明君的权力归还给你’，周公常常称是周王的命令，自主行事不请示汇报，所以说我把明君的权力归还给你。
"The Book of History [quotes the Duke of Chou] as saying, `We return [the government to Our] nephew, the intelligent prince.' The Duke of Chou constantly called [his orders] the mandates of the King, and acted on his own authority without reporting [matters to the King], hence he said, `I return [the government] to my nephew, the intelligent prince.'"

臣请安汉公居摄践祚，服天子韨冕，背斧依于户牖之间，南面朝群臣，听政事。
我们请求安汉公登上王位代理朝政，穿着天子的礼服礼帽，背靠门窗之间画有斧形花纹的屏风，面向南接见群臣，处理政务。
"Your subjects beg that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should act as Regent, mount the eastern steps, wear the apron and tasselled mortar-board hat of the Son of Heaven, turn his back to the axe-embroidered screen between the door and window, and face south as he holds court for the courtiers and attends to the business of government."

车服出入警跸，民臣称臣妾，皆如天子之制。
车马服饰出入时要清道戒严，平民和臣子都自称臣妾，全都依照天子的制度。
"When he goes in or out [of the Palace] in his chariot and robes, [the people] should be warned and [the streets] cleared. The common people and courtiers should call themselves his `subjects' or `female servants.' In all [these matters, he should be treated] as in the regulations for the Son of Heaven."

郊祀天地，宗祀明堂，共祀宗庙，享祭群神，赞曰‘假皇帝’，民臣谓之‘摄皇帝’，自称曰‘予’。
在郊外祭祀天地，在明堂祭祀祖宗，在宗庙祭祀祖先，祭祀众神，赞辞称‘假皇帝’，平民和臣子称他‘摄皇帝’，他自称‘予’。
"When he makes the suburban sacrifices to Heaven and to Earth, makes the sacrifice to the greatest exemplar of the house in the Ming-t'ang, makes offerings and sacrifices in the [imperial] ancestral temples, and performs worship and makes sacrifices to the many gods, in his presentation speech he should be called, `the Acting Emperor.' The common people and courtiers should speak of him as `the Regent-Emperor'; he should call himself `I'."

平决朝事，常以皇帝之诏称‘制’、以奉顺皇天之心，辅翼汉室，保安孝平皇帝之幼嗣，遂寄托之义，隆治平之化。
公平处理朝廷事务，常用皇帝的诏书形式称‘制’，以顺应上天之心，辅助汉室，保护孝平皇帝的幼嗣，完成寄托的大义，兴盛太平的教化。
"In judging and deciding matters [when holding] court, he should regularily employ the imperial edicts of the Emperor and pronounce [that he issues imperial] decrees, thereby upholding and obeying the will of August Heaven, assisting and protecting the House of Han, and guarding and tranquillizing the young heir to Emperor Hsiao-p'ing, [thus] carrying out the principle of entrusting [a Regent with the rule] and exalting the development of good government and peace."

其朝见太皇太后、帝皇后，皆复臣节。
他朝见太皇太后、皇后时，都恢复臣子的礼节。
"When he pays court at an audience of either the Grand Empress Dowager [nee Wang] or the Empress Dowager [nee Wang], he should reassume the devotion of a subject."

自施政教于其宫家国采，如诸侯礼仪故事。
在自己的宫室、封国、采地自行施行政治教化，依照诸侯礼仪的旧例。
"He should in his own person [as a noble] exercise the government and issue `instructions' to his own palace, his family, his [marquis's] estate, and his special territory [of Han-kuang], as in his previous practise, [according to] the legal practises of a noble."

臣昧死请。”太后诏曰：“可。”
我们冒死罪请求。”太后下诏说：“可以。”
"Your subjects, risking death, make this request." The edict of the [Grand] Empress Dowager said, "It is approved."

明年，改元曰“居摄”。
第二年，改年号为“居摄”。
"The next year, [Wang] Mang changed the year-period and called it Chü-shê (the Regency)."

居摄元年正月，莽祀上帝于南郊，迎春于东郊，行大射礼于明堂，养三老五更，成礼而去。
居摄元年正月，王莽在南郊祭祀上帝，在东郊迎接春天，在明堂举行大射礼，奉养三老、五更，礼仪完毕后离去。
"In [the year-period] Chü-shê, the first year, the first month, [Wang] Mang sacrificed to the Lords on High at the Southern [Altar for] the suburban sacrifice, welcomed the spring at the Eastern [Altar for] the suburban sacrifice, performed the rites of the great archery contest in the Ming-t'ang, and served food to Thrice Venerable and Fivefold Experienced. He completed the rites, then left."

置柱下五史，秩如御史，听政事，侍旁记疏言行。
设置柱下五史，俸禄如同御史，旁听处理政务，在旁边记录言行。
"He established the Five Clerks At the Foot of the Court Steno Pillars, with their rank like that of the [Attendant] Secretaries. When he attended to government business, they attended at his side and recorded and made detailed accounts of his words and acts."

三月己丑，立宣帝玄孙婴为皇太子，号曰孺子。
三月己丑日，立宣帝玄孙刘婴为皇太子，号称孺子。

以王舜为太傅左辅，甄丰为太阿右拂，甄邯为太保后承。
任命王舜为太傅左辅，甄丰为太阿右拂，甄邯为太保后承。

又置四少，秩皆二千石。
又设置四少，俸禄都是二千石。
"There were also established four Junior [Coadjutors] whose ranks were all two thousand piculs."

四月，安众侯刘崇与相张绍谋曰：“安汉公莽专制朝政，必危刘氏。
四月，安众侯刘崇和他的国相张绍商议说：“安汉公王莽独揽朝政，必定会危害刘氏王朝。
"In the fourth month, the Marquis of An-chung, Liu Ch'ung, plotted with his Chancellor, Chang Shao, saying, "The Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty, [Wang] Mang, acts on his own authority in holding court and exercizing the government, which will inevitably endanger the Liu clan."

天下非之者，乃莫敢先举，此宗室耻也。
天下反对他的人，却没有人敢首先行动，这是宗室的耻辱。
"No one of those in the empire who disapprove of it has however dared to be the first to make a move. This is a shame to the [imperial] house."

吾帅宗族为先，海内必和。”
我率领宗族率先行动，全国必定会响应。”
"I will give an example to the [imperial] house and clan and be the first [to attack. All] within [the four] seas will certainly respond."

绍等从者百余人，遂进攻宛，不得入而败。
张绍等跟随他的有一百多人，于是进攻宛城，没能攻进去就失败了。
"[Chang] Shao and others, who followed him, [to the number of] more than a hundred persons, thereupon made an assault upon [the city of] Yüan, [but] did not succeed in entering it and were defeated."

绍者，张竦之从兄也。
张绍是张竦的堂兄。
"[Chang] Shao was a cousin of Chang Sung."

竦与崇族父刘嘉诣阙自归，莽赦弗罪。
张竦和刘崇的族父刘嘉到皇宫自首，王莽赦免了他们，没有治罪。
"[Chang] Sung, with [Liu] Ch'ung's father's cousin, Liu Chia, went to [the palace] portals and surrendered of their own accord, [so that Wang] Mang pardoned them and did not condemn them."

竦因为嘉作奏曰：
张竦于是替刘嘉写了一份奏章说：
"Thereupon [Chang] Sung composed a memorial for [Liu] Chia, which said,"

建平、元寿之间，大统几绝，宗室几弃。
建平、元寿年间，皇位继承几乎断绝，宗室几乎被废弃。
"During [the year-periods] Chien-p'ing and Yüan-shou, when the main line [of the Han Dynasty] was in imminent danger of being cut short and the [imperial] house was in imminent danger of being overthrown,"

赖蒙陛下圣德，扶服振救，遮扞匡卫，国命复延，宗室明目。
幸亏依靠陛下的圣德，尽力挽救，保护扶持，国家命运得以延续，宗室重见光明。
"thanks to your Majesty [Wang Mang's] sage virtue, you `crawled on your knees to rescue and save it,' you protected and defended, succored and guarded it, so that the [heavenly] mandate of the [Han] state was again prolonged and the imperial house opened its eyes [again]."

临明统政，发号施令，动以宗室为始，登用九族为先。
到临朝执政，发号施令，行动以宗室为先，提拔任用九族的人优先。
"When you attended court, controlled the government, put out proclamations, and put forth ordinances, in your every act you made the imperial house the first [and most important consideration] and the promotion and employment of the nine [sets of imperial] relatives as the primary matter."

并录支亲，建立王侯，南面之孤，计以百数。
同时录用旁支亲属，封立王侯，面南称王称侯的人，数以百计。
"You have had included with them and recorded [upon the registers of the imperial house] cadet branches [of that house] and have established kings and marquises [from among these cadet branches], so that those who face south [in holding court and call themselves by the designation a noble uses for himself], ku, are numbered by the hundreds."

收复绝属，存亡续废，得比肩首，复为人者，嫔然成行，所以藩汉国，辅汉宗也。
恢复已经断绝的亲属关系，使灭亡的得以存在、废弃的得以延续，能够与其他人并列，重新成为人的，众多成行，以此来屏卫汉朝，辅助汉宗室。
"You gathered in and restored those members whose [registration in the imperial house] had been broken off, you preserved those [whose lines of descent as nobles] had died out, and you continued [those lines whose heads] had been dismissed [from their noble ranks], so that they form a numerous company who are able to be shoulder to shoulder and head to head [with the other nobles] and have been restored in their persons. You have thereby defended the Han [dynasty's] state and supported the Han clan."

建辟雍，立明堂，班天法，流圣化，朝群后，昭文德，宗室诸侯，咸益土地。
修建太学，建立明堂，颁布上天的法则，传播圣人的教化，接见诸侯，彰显文德，宗室诸侯，都增加了封地。
"You have established the Pi-yung and set up the Ming-t'ang to propagate the law of Heaven and to spread the influence of the sages. You have held court for the various princes in order to render your `culture and virtue' manifest. You have added to the lands and territory of all the nobles in the imperial house,"

天下喁喁，引领而叹，颂声洋洋，满耳而入。
天下人仰望期盼，伸颈赞叹，颂声洋溢，充耳可闻。
"so that all under Heaven lift up their heads, stick out their necks and sigh [with approval], and the sound of their praises is `magnificent and ear'-filling, and enters [the sense of hearing]."

国家所以服此美，膺此名，飨此福，受此荣者，岂非太皇太后日昃之思，陛下夕惕之念哉！
国家之所以能享有这样的美誉，获得这样的名声，享受这样的福分，得到这样的荣耀，难道不是太皇太后日理万机的思虑，陛下日夜警惕的挂念吗！
"The reason that the state has gained this beauty, has obtained this fame, has enjoyed these blessings, and has received this glory—is it not [the result of the fact that] the Grand Empress Dowager considers [that she must be diligent until] `sundown' and that `in the evening' your Majesty is still `carefully' contemplating [your duties]? How [otherwise could it be] explained?"

何谓？乱则统其理，危则致其安，祸则引其福，绝则继其统，幼则代其任，晨夜屑屑，寒暑勤勤，无时休息，孳孳不已者，凡以为天，厚刘氏也。
为什么呢？因为遇到混乱就加以治理，遇到危险就使它安定，遇到灾祸就引向福祉，遇到断绝就延续其统绪，遇到幼主就代替他承担责任，早晚辛劳，寒暑不懈，没有休息的时候，孜孜不倦，所有这些都是为了上天，厚待刘氏。
"When there has been disorder, you have controlled it; when there has been danger, you have turned it to tranquillity; when there has been calamity, you have led it to happiness; when [lines of descent] have been cut off, you have continued their succession, when [the Emperor] is young, you have taken his place and borne his burdens. Day and night, you have performed detailed labor; in cold and in heat, you have been diligent, without any time for relaxation, with unending unwearied effort. All was for the sake of the empire and to favor the Liu clan."

臣无愚智，民无男女，皆谕至意。
臣子无论愚笨聪明，百姓无论男女，都明白您的深远用意。
"The courtiers, whether stupid or wise, and the common people, whether male or female, have all understood your high intentions."

而安众侯崇乃独怀悖惑之心，操畔逆之虑，兴兵动众，欲危宗庙，恶不忍闻，罪不容诛，诚臣子之仇，宗室之雠，国家之贼，天下之害也。
然而安众侯刘崇却偏偏怀着荒谬迷惑之心，抱着叛逆的念头，兴师动众，想要危害宗庙，恶行令人不忍听闻，罪行大到处死都不能抵偿，实在是臣子的仇敌，宗室的仇人，国家的蟊贼，天下的祸害。
"But the Marquis of An-chung, [Liu] Ch'ung, alone entertained perverse illusions in his heart and held rebellious thoughts, so that he raised his troops and moved the multitude, intending to endanger the imperial [ancestral] temples. Of his wickedness one cannot endure to hear and for his crime one cannot be patient with [mere] execution. Verily, he was an enemy of [loyal] subjects and [filial] sons, a foe of the imperial house, a rebel against the state, and an injury to the country."

是故亲属震落而告其罪，民人溃畔而弃其兵，进不跬步，退伏其殃。
因此亲属震惊而告发他的罪行，百姓溃散背叛而抛弃他的兵器，前进不了半步，后退就遭受灾祸。
"For this reason, his clan and relatives by marriage quaked, became distant to him and gave information of his crimes; the common people dispersed, rebelled against him, and threw away their arms, so that in advancing he could not [take] a step and when he retired he suffered the calamity [visited upon] him [by Heaven]."

百岁之母，孩提之子，同时断斩，悬头竿杪，珠珥在耳，首饰犹存，为计若此，岂不悖哉！
百岁的母亲，还在襁褓中的婴儿，同时被斩杀，头颅悬挂在竹竿顶端，珠耳环还在耳上，首饰依然存在，如此谋划，难道不荒谬吗！
"His mother, who was near the end of her life, and his smiling babes, carried in [their nurses'] arms, were beheaded at the same time with him; their heads were hung on the ends of poles with their pearl earrings [still] in their ears and their hair ornaments still on [their heads]. How can it not be perverse to make a plan such as this?"

臣闻古者畔逆之国，既以诛讨，则猪其宫室以为污池，纳垢浊焉，名曰凶虚，虽生菜茹，而人不食。
我听说古代叛逆的国家，被讨伐诛杀之后，就把它的宫室挖成水池，用来容纳污浊之物，名叫凶墟，即使长出蔬菜，人们也不吃。
"Your servant has heard that anciently, when [the head of] a rebellious state had already been punished, then they made a pool out of his palace-buildings, making them a stagnant pond, and put filth into it, calling its name, `The baleful waste,' so that, although it might grow vegetables, yet people would not eat them."

四墙其社，覆上栈下，示不得通。
用墙把它的神社围起来，上面覆盖下面铺垫，以示阴阳不通。
"They put four walls [around] its mound to the gods of the soils, covered it above, and put a mat [on it] below, so that spirits of the earth could not communicate [with those of heaven."

辨社诸侯，出门见之，著以为戒。
把这种处置神社的方式通报诸侯，让他们出门就能看到，作为明显的警戒。
"The soil of] its mound was distributed to the nobles' [altars for the gods of the soils], so that when they went out of their gates and saw it, it would be visible to them as a warning."

方今天下闻崇之反也，咸欲骞衣手剑而叱之。
当今天下听说刘崇叛乱，都想撩起衣襟手持宝剑去呵斥他。
"Just now, when the empire heard that [Liu] Ch'ung rebelled, all wanted to raise up [the skirts of] their robes, [take] a two-edged sword in their hand, and rail at him."

其先至者，则拂其颈，冲其匈，刃其躯，切其肌；
那些先赶到的人，会砍他的脖子，刺他的胸膛，劈他的身体，割他的肌肉；
"Those who first reached him, cut his throat, struck his breast, pierced his body, and hacked his flesh."

后至者，欲拔其门，仆其墙，夷其屋，焚其器，应声涤地，则时成创。
后赶到的人，想拆他的门，推倒他的墙，铲平他的屋，烧毁他的器物，响应之声使地面震动，即刻造成创伤。
"Those who came later wanted to pull down his gates, break down his walls, raze his houses, and burn his utensils. [As rapidly as] an echo follows a sound, [their blood] stained the earth, so immediately was a wound created [in people's feelings]."

而宗室尤甚，言必切齿焉。
而宗室尤其痛恨，说起他来必定咬牙切齿。
"The [members of] the imperial house moreover [felt it] especially keenly, so that, when they spoke of him, they inevitably gnashed their teeth."

何则？以其背畔恩义，而不知重德之所在也。
为什么呢？因为他背叛恩义，不知道重要的恩德在哪里。
"Why so? Because he had gone contrary to and rebelled against your favor and beneficence and did not recognize where the greatest virtue lay."

宗室所居或远，嘉幸得先闻，不胜愤愤之愿，愿为宗室倡始，父子兄弟负笼荷锸，驰之南阳，猪崇宫室，令如古制。
宗室居住的地方有的遥远，我刘嘉有幸能先听到消息，满腔愤怒无法抑制，愿意作为宗室的表率，父子兄弟背着筐扛着锹，奔赴南阳，把刘崇的宫室挖成水池，使它符合古代制度。
"The [members of] the imperial house, for the most part, live at places distant [from Yüan]; I, Chia, have been fortunate to have been able to hear of [his rebellion] first and have not [been able] to resist my indignant desire. I wish to take the lead of the imperial house, myself, [with] my sons and my elder and younger brothers, to carry baskets on our shoulders and to bear mattocks, gallop to Nan-yang [Commandery], and make a pond of [Liu] Ch'ung's palace-buildings, in order to cause them to be according to the ancient institutions."

及崇社宜如毫社，以赐诸侯，用永监戒。
至于刘崇的神社应当像毫社一样处理，把它赐给诸侯，用来永远作为借鉴。
"They, together with the mound to the gods of the soils belonging to [Liu] Ch'ung, should be like the mound to the gods of the soils at Po, and should be used to grant to the nobles, in order that it may be an eternal lesson and warning."

愿下四辅公卿大夫议，以明好恶，视四方。
希望把这件事交给四辅、公卿大夫讨论，以表明善恶，昭示天下。
"I wish that [this matter] may be referred to the Four Coadjutors, the ministers, and the grandees, for discussion, in order to make plain its right and wrong and to show it [as an example] to the four quarters [of the empire]."

于是莽大说。
于是王莽非常高兴。
"[Wang] Mang was thereupon very much pleased."

公卿曰：“皆宜如嘉言。”
公卿们说：“都应该按照刘嘉说的办。”
"The ministers all said, "It would be proper [to do] as [Liu] Chia says,"

"The Junior Supporter, the Hsi-and-Ho, Liu Hsin, with the Erudits and Confucians [to the number of] 78 persons [altogether], all said,"The principle of acting as Regent is to direct the performance of the duties established by Heaven, to promote the reverencing of the way of [the ancient Sage]-lords, to bring to a successful issue the laws and regulations, and to make tranquil and concordant [all] within [the four] seas."

昔殷成汤既没，而太子蚤夭，其子太甲幼少不明，伊尹放诸桐宫而居摄，以兴殷道。
从前商汤去世后，太子早夭，他的儿子太甲年幼不明事理，伊尹把他放逐到桐宫而代理朝政，以兴盛商朝的王道。
"Anciently, when T'ang the Victorious of the Yin [dynasty,即商汤] had died and his Heir-apparent had died in his youth, his son T'ai-chia was a minor and unintelligent, so Yi Yin banished him to the T'ung Palace and acted as Regent in order to promote the course of the Yin [dynasty,即商朝]."

周武王既没，周道未成，成王幼少，周公屏成王而居摄，以成周道。
周武王去世后，周朝的王道尚未完成，成王年幼，周公扶持成王而代理朝政，以完成周朝的王道。
"When King Wu of the Chou [dynasty] had died, the ways of the Chou [dynasty] had not yet been completed and `King Ch'eng was young' and a minor, `so the Duke of Chou protected King Ch'eng' and acted as Regent in order to perfect the ways of the Chou [dynasty]."

是以殷有翼翼之化，周有刑错之功。
因此商朝有恭谨美好的教化，周朝有刑罚搁置不用的功绩。
"For this reason the Yin [dynasty] had the development of being`orderly' and the Chou [dynasty] had the merit of establishing but not employing the mutilating punishments."

今太皇太后比遭家之不造，委任安汉公宰尹群僚，衡平天下。
如今太皇太后接连遭遇家中不幸，委任安汉公治理百官，平定天下。
"Now the Grand Empress Dowager has frequently`happened upon untoward circumstances in the state,' and has commissioned the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty to rule and control the various officials, and to govern the empire justly."

遭孺子幼少，未能共上下，皇天降瑞，出丹石之符，是以太皇太后则天明命，诏安汉公居摄践祚，将以成圣汉之业，与唐、虞三代比隆也。
遇上孺子年幼，不能恭敬地侍奉天地神灵，皇天降下祥瑞，出现丹石符命，因此太皇太后顺应上天明命，诏令安汉公代理皇位，将以此成就圣明汉朝的大业，与唐尧、虞舜、夏商周三代比美。
"It has happened that since the Young Prince is a minor and has not yet been able to be diligently respectful to [the gods] above and below, August Heaven has sent down auspicious presages and has produced the portent of the red stone. For this reason, the Grand Empress Dowager followed the plain mandate of Heaven and issued an imperial edict that the Duke Giving Tranquillity to the Han Dynasty should act as Regent and mount the eastern steps in order that he might perform the duties of the sage Han [dynasty] and make it equally eminent with that of T'ang [Yao], Yü [Shun], and the three dynasties."

摄皇帝遂开秘府，会群儒，制礼作乐，卒定庶官，茂成天功。
代理皇帝于是打开秘府，会集儒生，制定礼乐，最终确定百官制度，盛大地完成了上天的功业。
"The Regent-Emperor thereupon opened his private yamen and met with various Confucians to institute rites and compose [the proper] music, to assist in fixing the [titles of] the many offices, and to complete beautifully the work of Heaven."

圣心周悉，卓尔独见，发得周礼，以明因监，则天稽古，而损益焉，犹仲尼之闻《韶》，日月之不可阶，非圣哲之至，孰能若兹！
圣明的心思周密详尽，卓越独特的见解，发掘出周朝礼制，以明了继承与借鉴，效法上天，考察古制，加以增减，就像孔子听到《韶》乐，像日月一样高不可攀，不是圣明智慧达到极致，谁能做到这样！
"His sage mind is in all respects complete, and eminent are his individual insights. The Chou Rites (the Chou-li) was discovered and secured, so that it was made plain what should be followed' and surveyed'. He took Heaven as his model and searched out ancient ways, yet modified them. It was just as when [K'ung Ch'iu] Chung-ni heard [the music] Shao, and [just as] the sun and moon' cannot [be climbed up to by any] stairs.' If [Wang Mang] had not the utmost of sage wisdom, how could he have been able to perform these [deeds]?"

纲幻咸张，成在一匮，此其所以保佑圣汉，安靖元元之效也。
大纲和细目都已完备，成功在即，这就是用来保佑圣明汉朝，安定百姓的成效。
"The fundamental and subordinate principles [of government] are all displayed and completed [except for] one basketful. These [matters] are the means by which he has devoted himself to protecting and assisting the sage Han [dynasty] and giving tranquillity to the great multitude."

今功显君薨，《礼》：‘庶子为后，为其母緦。’
如今功显君去世，《礼记》说：‘庶子作为继承人，为他的母亲服缌麻之丧。’
"Now the Baronetess of Apparent Merits has died. The [Ceremonies and] Rites [Yi]-li [says],`The son of a concubine who becomes the heir [of his father] wears the three-month's szu mourning for his own mother,'"

传曰：‘与尊者为体，不敢服其私亲也。
传文说：‘与尊贵的人成为一体，不敢为自己的亲属服丧。’
"and the explanation says,`He is in the same position as the most honorable person [in the family, i.e., his father, and so] should not presume to wear [deep] mourning for his own mother.'"

摄皇帝以圣德承皇天之命，受太后之诏居摄践祚，奉汉大宗之后，上有天地社稷之重，下有元元万机之忧，不得顾其私亲。
代理皇帝以圣德承受皇天的使命，接受太后的诏令代理皇位，侍奉汉朝大宗的后代，对上有天地社稷的重任，对下有百姓万机的忧虑，不能顾及自己的亲属。
"The Regent-Emperor has, through his sage virtue, obtained the mandate of August Heaven, received the imperial edict of the [Grand] Empress Dowager that he should act as Regent and mount the eastern steps, and support the descendant of the great Han imperial family. On the one hand, he has his weighty [duties] to Heaven, Earth, and the gods of the soils and the grains, and on the other hand, he has the care of the great multitude and the multifarious matters [of the government], so that he is not permitted to consider his own relatives."

故太皇太后建厥元孙，俾侯新都，为哀侯后。
因此太皇太后立他的长孙，使他为新都侯，作为哀侯的后代。
"Hence the Grand Empress Dowager has established his eldest grandson [as a noble], causing him to be the marquis at Hsin-tu and the successor to Marquis Ai, [Wang Wan], making plain that the Regent-Emperor is in the same position as the most honorable person, [the Emperor],"

明摄皇帝与尊者为体，承宗庙之祭，奉共养太皇太后，不得服其私亲也。

《周礼》曰‘王为诸侯緦縗’，‘弁而加环绖’，同姓则麻，异姓则葛。
《周礼》说‘帝王为诸侯服缌麻丧’，‘戴弁加环绖’，同姓用麻，异姓用葛。
"The Chou Rites (Chou-li) says, A king, . . . [in wearing mourning] for his nobles, [wears] the hemp mourning badge and cap,' to which there is added a ring of hemp banding.' If [the nobles] are of the same surname [as the king], then [his mourning gar ments] are of hemp (Cannabis); if they are of a different surname, then they are of ke hemp (Pueraria)."

摄皇帝当为功显君緦縗，弁而加麻环绖，如天子吊诸侯服，以应圣制。’
代理皇帝应当为功显君服缌麻丧，戴弁加麻环绖，如同天子吊唁诸侯的丧服，以符合圣制。’
"The Regent-Emperor ought to wear the hemp mourning badge for the Baronetess of Apparent Merits and a cap to which there has been added a hemp ring of banding, like the mourning garments of the Son of Heaven in condoling his nobles, in order to respond to the institutions of the sages."

莽遂行焉，凡一吊再会，而令新都侯宗为主，服丧三年云。
王莽于是照办，总共吊唁两次聚会两次，而让新都侯王宗主持丧事，服丧三年。
"[Wang] Mang therefore acted [accordingly]. Altogether he paid one mourning [visit] and a second [time] assembled [the mourners] and ordered the Marquis of Hsin-tu, [Wang] Tsung, to be in charge [of the ceremonies] and wear mourning to the third year."

遂母子自杀，及况皆死。
于是母子自杀，连同窦况都死了。

起初，王莽以侍奉母亲、供养嫂子、抚养侄子闻名，到后来却违背情理变得残暴，又用这来显示公正大义。

Then later, his perversity and cruelty were again used to show [that he was actuated by] public spirit and sense of duty."

In the first month [of the next year], at the suburban sacrifices, the eight [kinds of] musical instruments should be played."

王公卿士，乐凡几等？五声八音，条各云何？
王公卿士，音乐共分几等？五声八音，各条是什么？
