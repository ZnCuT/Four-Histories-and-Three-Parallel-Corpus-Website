季布匿濮阳周氏。
季布躲藏在濮阳一个姓周的人家中。
Ji Bu took refuge in Puyang with a man named Zhou.

周氏曰：“汉购将军急，迹且至臣家，将军能听臣，臣敢献计；即不能，愿先自刭。”
周氏说：“汉朝悬赏捉拿将军十分紧急，追查的踪迹很快就要到我家了。将军若能听我的建议，我就敢献上计策；要是不能，我情愿先自杀。”
who told him, ‘The emperor is searching hard for you, general, and will soon trace you here. If you are willing to take my advice, I shall venture to propose a plan. If not, I had better kill myself.”

季布许之。
季布答应了他。
Ji Bu agreed to his plan.

乃髡钳季布，衣褐衣，置广柳车中，并与其家僮数十人，之鲁朱家所卖之。
于是周氏给季布剃去头发、套上铁颈锁，让他穿上粗布衣服，把他放进运棺材的广柳车里，连同周家的几十个家僮一起，送到鲁县朱家那里卖掉。
and let himself be shaved and dressed in coarse clothes, with an iron chain round his neck. Then he was sent in a covered wagon with several dozen slaves to be sold to Zhu Jia in Lu.

朱家心知是季布，乃买而置之田，诫其子曰：“田事听此奴，必与同食。”
朱家心里知道这人是季布，买下他后把他安置在田庄里，告诫儿子说：“田里的事都听这个家奴的安排，一定要和他一起吃饭。”
Zhu Jia, knowing that this was Ji Bu, bought him and set him to work on his farm. He instructed his son, “You must farm as this slave says and share your meals with him.”

朱家乃乘轺车之洛阳，见汝阴侯滕公。
朱家于是乘坐轻便马车前往洛阳，拜见汝阴侯滕公（夏侯婴）。

滕公留朱家喝了好几天酒。
The latter entertained him for several days.

因谓滕公曰：“季布何大罪，而上求之急也？”
朱家趁机对滕公说：“季布犯了什么大罪，皇上捉拿他这么急迫呢？”
and Zhu Jia found an opportunity to ask, “What is Ji Bu's great crime that the emperor is searching so hard for him?”

滕公曰：“布数为项羽窘上，上怨之，故必欲得之。”
滕公回答：“季布多次替项羽使皇上陷入困境，皇上怨恨他，所以一定要抓到他。”
“Ji Bu often had him on the spot when he was fighting for Xiang Yu,” replied Lord Teng. “The emperor bears him such a grudge that he has set his heart on capturing him.”

朱家曰：“君视季布何如人也？”
朱家问：“您看季布是个怎样的人？”
“What is your opinion of Ji Bu?”

曰：“贤者也。”
滕公说：“是个贤能的人。”
“An able man.”

朱家曰：“臣各为其主用，季布为项籍用，职耳。
朱家说：“臣子各自为自己的君主效力，季布为项籍效力，不过是尽他的职责罢了。

项氏臣可尽诛邪？
项氏的臣子难道能全都杀掉吗？
Does the emperor mean to kill all Xiang Yu's followers?

今上始得天下，独以己之私怨求一人，何示天下之不广也！
如今皇上刚夺得天下，却只为自己的私怨捉拿一个人，这多让天下人看出他心胸不宽广啊！
The empire is newly won and if the emperor hounds one man on account of a private grudge, how narrow-minded the world is going to think him!

且以季布之贤而汉求之急如此，此不北走胡即南走越耳。
况且像季布这样贤能的人，汉朝却如此急迫地追捕他，他不是向北逃到匈奴，就是向南逃到南越（只会帮敌国）。
Besides, if Ji Bu is an able man and the emperor hounds him like this, he will escape north to the Huns or south to the Yues.

夫忌壮士以资敌国，此伍子胥所以鞭荆平王之墓也。
忌恨壮士反而让他去帮助敌国，这就是当年伍子胥掘楚平王墓鞭尸的原因啊。
Goading a good man into helping an enemy state was what made Wu Zixu whip the grave of the king of Chu.

君何不从容为上言邪？”
您为什么不找个合适的机会对皇上说说这些呢？”
Might you mention this to the emperor if an occasion arises?”

汝阴侯滕公心知朱家大侠，意季布匿其所，乃许曰：“诺。”
汝阴侯滕公心里知道朱家是有名的侠义之士，猜测季布就藏在他家里，于是答应说：“好。”
Lord Teng knew that Zhu Jia was noble-minded and guessed that Ji Bu was hiding with him, so he agreed.

待间，果言如朱家旨。
等到有了机会，滕公果然按朱家的意思向皇上进言。
Later he found occasion to speak to the emperor as Zhu Jia had suggested.

上乃赦季布。

and Ji Bu was pardoned.

当是时，诸公皆多季布能摧刚为柔，朱家亦以此名闻当世。
当时，大臣们都赞赏季布能“变刚强为柔顺”（放下身段避祸），朱家也因此在当时闻名。

季布曰：“樊哙可斩也！
季布说：“樊哙该杀！
But Ji Bu said, "Fan Kuai deserves to lose his head.

夫高帝将兵四十余万众，困于平城，今哙奈何以十万众横行匈奴中，面欺！
高祖曾率领四十多万大军，还被匈奴围困在平城，如今樊哙怎么能凭十万人马就说能在匈奴境内横冲直撞，这是当面骗人！
The First Emperor, with more than four hundred thousand men, was nevertheless surrounded at Pingcheng. Now Fan Kuai with a hundred thousand will make the Huns scatter before him. A bare-faced lie!

且秦以事于胡，陈胜等起。
况且秦朝就是因为对匈奴用兵，才引发陈胜等人的起义。
Besides, it was Qin's campaigns against the Huns that enabled Chen She and the rest to start a rebellion.

复有言其勇，使酒难近。
又有人说他勇猛，但爱喝酒、发脾气，让人难以亲近。
Then, however, it was reported that he was reckless, headstrong when in his cups, and hard to deal with.

至，留邸一月，见罢。
季布到了京城，在客馆住了一个月，只被皇上召见一次就没了下文（未被任用）。
So after his arrival he was lodged in a government hostel for a month and then dismissed.

季布因进曰：“臣无功窃宠，待罪河东。
季布于是进言：“我没有功劳却承蒙恩宠，在河东郡担任太守（自谦“待罪”，指任职）。
When he went to take his leave of the emperor, he said, "For no merit of mine, I was favoured with the governorship of Hedong.

陛下无故召臣，此人必有以臣欺陛下者。
陛下平白无故召见我，这一定是有人拿我来欺骗陛下（夸大我的能力）。
then received an unexpected summons to court, due no doubt to an unwarranted recommendation.

今臣至，无所受事，罢去，此人必有以毁臣者。
如今我到了京城，却没被安排任何职务就被打发回去，这一定是有人在陛下面前诋毁我。
Since my arrival, however, I have been given no new appointment but dismissed, due no doubt to some detractor.

夫陛下以一人之誉而召臣，一人之毁而去臣，臣恐天下有识闻之有以窥陛下也。”
陛下因为一个人的称赞就召见我，因为一个人的诋毁就赶走我，我担心天下有见识的人听说这件事后，会借此看透陛下的胸襟啊。”
Apparently Your Majesty summoned me on one man's recommendation and dismissed me because another spoke ill of me. I fear that all intelligent men who hear this will know how to judge you, sir.”

上默然惭，良久曰：“河东吾股肱郡，故特召君耳。”
汉文帝沉默不语，面露惭愧，过了好一会儿才说：“河东是我重要的郡（像大腿和胳膊一样关键），所以特地召见你罢了。”

他侍奉权贵赵同等人，还和窦长君（汉文帝皇后之兄）关系很好。

季布闻之，寄书谏窦长君曰：“吾闻曹丘生非长者，勿与通。”
季布听说后，寄信劝窦长君说：“我听说曹丘生不是品德高尚的人，别和他来往。”
When Ji Bu knew this he wrote to warn Lord Dou, “I hear bad reports of Caoqiu Sheng. Better have nothing to do with the man!”

及曹丘生归，欲得书请季布。
等到曹丘生要返回楚国，想让窦长君写封介绍信去拜见季布。
As Caoqiu Sheng was about to return to Chu, he asked Lord Dou for a letter of introduction to Ji Bu.

窦长君曰：“季将军不说足下，足下无往。”

他先派人把信送给季布，季布果然非常愤怒，等着曹丘生前来。
The letter of introduction was sent on ahead and, sure enough, Ji Bu was very angry as he waited for the orator.

曹丘至，即揖季布曰：“楚人谚曰‘得黄金百，不如得季布一诺’，足下何以得此声于梁楚间哉？
曹丘生到了，马上向季布作揖说：“楚国有句谚语‘得到一百斤黄金，不如得到季布的一句承诺’，您怎么能在梁国、楚国一带获得这样的名声呢？
Caoqiu, arriving, bowed to Ji Bu and said, ‘The men of Chu have a saying, ‘A promise from Ji Bu is worth more than a hundred catties of gold.' How did you make such a name for yourself in Liang and Chu?

且仆楚人，足下亦楚人也。
况且我是楚国人，您也是楚国人。
I am a native of Chu and so are you.

仆游扬足下之名于天下，顾不重邪？
我周游天下，到处宣扬您的名声，难道这还不重要吗？
Have I not done much to spread your fame through the world?

何足下距仆之深也！”
您为什么这么坚决地拒绝我呢！”
Why should you be so prejudiced against me?”

季布乃大说，引入，留数月，为上客，厚送之。
季布于是非常高兴，把曹丘生请进屋里，留他住了几个月，待为上宾，临走时还送了他丰厚的礼物。
Ji Bu was very pleased. He invited Caoqiu in and kept him for several months as his honoured guest, loading him with rich gifts when he left.

季布名所以益闻者，曹丘扬之也。
季布的名声之所以更加响亮，就是因为曹丘生替他宣扬啊。

皇上说：“还要说什么?”
"What is it?" demanded the emperor.

布曰：“方上之困于彭城，败荥阳、成皋间，项王所以不能遂西，徒以彭王居梁地，与汉合从苦楚也。”
栾布说：“当年皇上被围困在彭城，在荥阳、成皋一带战败的时候，项王之所以不能最终向西追击，只是由于彭王在梁地，与汉军联合牵制楚军的缘故。”

现在陛下一声令下到梁国征调军队，彭王因重病不能随行，而陛下就怀疑是要造反，造反的证据也没看到，就以琐细的事情为罪名把他杀了，我担心功臣会人人自危了。
Then you summoned his army from Liang and, just because he was too ill to come, suspected that he had rebelled. With no real evidence, you executed him on a flimsy pretext. All your other worthy subjects must fear for their lives.

今彭王已死，臣生不如死，请就亨。”
