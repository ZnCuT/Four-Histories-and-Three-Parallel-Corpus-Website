赤县神州里面又有九州，这就是大禹所划分的九州，但这不能算是真正的“州”的数目。

其术皆此类也，然要其归，必止乎仁义节俭，君臣上下六亲之施。
驺衍的学说大都是这一类内容，但是他学说的最终目的，还是要归结到仁义节俭，以及君臣、上下、六亲之间伦理关系的实施上。
Zou Yan's theories were all of this sort. Yet these were the premises for his conclusions about humanity, justice, frugality and the relationships between ruler and ruled, high and low, and kinsmen.

So Zou Yan wrote The Sovereign's Way.

其游诸侯见尊礼如此，岂与仲尼菜色陈、蔡、孟轲困于齐、梁同乎哉！
驺衍周游各国时受到这样的尊宠，这和孔子当初被围困在陈、蔡之间饿得面如菜色，以及孟子在齐国、梁国所受的冷遇，又怎能同日而语呢？
Every state he visited received him with honour. How different from the case of Confucius, who underwent hunger in Chen and Cai, or of Mencius who was hard put to it in Qi and Liang!

故武王以仁义伐纣而王，伯夷饿不食周粟；
所以周武王尽管是靠着仁义打败了殷纣称王的，但也还是有伯夷宁肯饿死也不愿吃周朝的粮食；

或曰，伊尹负鼎而勉汤以王，百里奚饭牛车下而缪公用霸，作先合，然后引之大道。
也有人说：伊尹曾背着饭锅去求见汤，结果辅佐汤统一了天下；百里奚也曾以在车下喂牛的办法接近了秦穆公，后来帮着秦穆公成就了霸业，都是先设法接近，而后再慢慢地引导国君走上正道。
Some point out, however, that Yi Yin served Tang as a cook before making him a king, and Baili Xi grazed his oxen in front of Duke Mu's chariot before serving him and making him a conqueror; for they had to meet the ruler first before leading him to the right path.

驺衍其言虽不轨，傥亦有牛鼎之意乎？
驺衍学说的这种不合常轨，也许就是伊尹负鼎、百里饭牛的那种意思吧？
Although Zou Yan's teachings were unorthodox, he may have had the same idea as these men.

自驺衍与齐之稷下先生，如淳于髡、慎到、环渊、接子、田骈、驺奭之徒，各著书言治乱之事，以干世主，岂可胜道哉！
自从驺衍和齐国稷下的淳于髡、慎到、环渊、接子、田骈、驺奭等人著书立说，探讨治乱兴亡，以此求得国君的赏识以来，这样的人就越来越多，没法说了。
After Zou Yan came the scholars of the Ji Xia Academy in Qi, men like Chunyu Kun, Shen Dao, Huan Yuan, Jie Zi, Tian Pian and Zou shi, who wrote about government to advise the princes of their time. They are too many to enumerate here.

淳于髡，齐人也。博闻强记，学无所主。
淳于髡是齐国人，见识多记性好，做学问不专注于一家。
Chunyu Kun, a native of Qi, had wide knowledge and a retentive memory and belonged to no particular school of thought.

其谏说，慕晏婴之为人也，然而承意观色为务。
爱给国君提意见，仰慕并且努力学习晏婴的做事和为人，所不同的是，他特别注意察言观色，寻找适当的时机。
In offering advice he took Yan Ying as his model, but paid careful attention to the ruler's reactions.

客有见髡于梁惠王，惠王屏左右，独坐而再见之，终无言也。
有人把他引见给了梁惠王，梁惠王支开了身边的人，单独地两次接见了他。结果他都一言未发。
Once someone introduced him to King Hui of Liang, who twice dismissed everyone else to receive him in private, but not a word did Chunyu Kun say.

惠王怪之，以让客曰：“子之称淳于先生，管、晏不及，及见寡人，寡人未有得也。岂寡人不足为言邪？何故哉？”
梁惠王很奇怪，就责备当初引见的那个人说：“你曾向我称赞淳于髡，说连管仲、晏婴都比不上他，可是淳于髡见过了我，我却一无所获。难道是我不配和他说话吗？他为什么见了我一言不发呢？”
The astonished king told the man who had introduced him, "You recommended Master Chunyu as superior even to Guan Zhong and Yan Ying, but I have learned nothing from him. Am I unworthy of his advice? Or what is the reason?"

客以谓髡。髡曰：“固也。吾前见王，王志在驱逐；后复见王，王志在音声：吾是以默然。”
这个人回去把梁惠王的话转告给了淳于髡。淳于髡说：“我的确没说话。那是因为我第一次见到你们大王时，他正想着骑马奔跑；第二次我见到他时，他正想着美妙的旋律，所以我只好不说话了。”
When this was repeated to Chunyu Kun, he said, "True. The first time I saw the king his thoughts were on charioteering. The second time his thoughts were on music. So I kept quiet."

客具以报王，王大骇，曰：“嗟乎，淳于先生诚圣人也！前淳于先生之来，人有献善马者，寡人未及视，会先生至。后先生之来，人有献讴者，未及试，亦会先生来。寡人虽屏人，然私心在彼，有之。”
这个人回去又把淳于髡的话报告了梁惠王。梁惠王一听大吃一惊，说：“啊呀！淳于先生可真是个圣人啊！头一次他来见我之前，有人送给我一匹好马，我还没有来得及去看，正好这时淳于髡来了；第二次淳于髡来之前，又正好有人献我一名歌女，我还没有来得及去试听，也刚好这时淳于髡来了；那时我虽打发开了身边的人，但我心里的确还是在想着别的事，这是实情。”
As soon as the king was informed of this, he exclaimed in astonishment, "Ah, Master Chunyu must certainly be a sage! When he first came, I had just been given a fine horse and had no time to examine it. The second time, I had just been given some musicians but had no time to hear them. Although I dismissed everyone else, it is true that my thoughts were elsewhere."

后淳于髡见，壹语连三日三夜无倦。
后来淳于髡又见到了梁惠王，这次和梁惠王一口气谈了三天三夜，两人都不觉得疲倦。
Chunyu Kun subsequently saw the king again and they talked for three days and three nights without wearying.

惠王欲以卿相位待之，髡因谢去。
梁惠王想让淳于髡在齐国充任公卿宰相，淳于髡不愿接受，要求回家。
King Hui wished to make him a high minister, but he declined and withdrew.

于是送以安车驾驷，束帛加璧，黄金百镒。终身不仕。
于是梁惠王便给他安排了一辆很舒适的四匹马拉的车子，送给了他十匹缯帛外加璧玉的礼品，还有黄金两千多斤。淳于髡一辈子没有做过官。
Then the king presented him with a fine carriage drawn by four horses, as well as rolls of silk, some jade and two thousand yi of gold. He accepted no official post all his life.

驺奭也是齐国驺姓的学者，也多采用驺衍的学说来撰写文章。
Zou Shi, another of the Zou scholars of Qi, recorded the teachings of Zou Yan in his writings.

于是齐王嘉之，自如淳于髡以下，皆命曰列大夫，为开第康庄之衢，高门大屋，尊宠之。
因此齐王赏识他们，从淳于髡以下的这些人，都被任命为列大夫，齐王还为他们在宽阔平坦的大街上修建府第，都是高大门户的大宅，对他们非常尊崇宠爱。
The king of Qi favoured these scholars. From Chunyu Kun down he gave them all the rank of ministers and honoured them by building large mansions, broad avenues and imposing gates for them.

览天下诸侯宾客，言齐能致天下贤士也。
（这样做是为了）让天下诸侯的宾客看到，表明齐国能招纳天下贤才。
This was to show the protégés of other rulers that the king of Qi was a good patron.

荀卿，赵人。年五十始来游学于齐。
荀卿是赵国人，五十岁时才到齐国游学。
Xun Qing was a native of Zhao who went to Qi when he was fifty to spread his teachings.

驺衍之术迂大而闳辩；奭也文具难施；淳于髡久与处，时有得善言。
驺衍的学说迂阔宏大且善于雄辩；驺奭的文章完备但难以施行；和淳于髡相处久了，时常能听到有益的言论。
Zou Yan's arguments were diffuse and highflown, Zou Shi had literary talent but his theories were difficult to put into practice, and if you spent long enough with Chunyu Kun you could occasionally catch words of wisdom.

故齐人颂曰：“谈天衍，雕龙奭，炙毂过髡。”
所以齐国人称颂道：“谈天说地数驺衍，雕琢文辞看驺奭，言谈风趣属淳于髡。”
Hence the men of Qi commented, "Zou Yan talks about heaven, Zou Shi is a fine stylist, and Chunyu Kun is a fluent speaker."

李斯曾是他的弟子，后来做了秦国的丞相。
Li Si, later prime minister of Qin, was one of Xun Qing's pupils.

荀卿嫉浊世之政，亡国乱君相属，不遂大道而营于巫祝，信祥，鄙儒小拘，如庄周等又猾稽乱俗贤，于是推儒、墨、道德之行事兴坏，序列著数万言而卒。
荀卿痛恨乱世的政治，亡国昏君接连不断，他们不遵循治国正道却热衷于巫术祈祷，迷信吉凶征兆，浅陋的儒生拘泥小节，像庄周等人又用诙谐的言辞扰乱世俗，于是荀卿推究儒家、墨家、道家学说的成败得失，编写著述了几万字后去世。
Xun Qing hated the corrupt governments of his day, the decadent states and evil princes who did not follow the Way but gave their attention to magic and prayers and believed in omens and luck. The Confucian scholars of his generation were petty and narrow-minded, while thinkers such as Zhuang Zhou were wild and destructive of public morality. So Xun Qing expounded the advantages and disadvantages of practising the Confucian, Mohist and Taoist teachings. By the time of his death he had written tens of thousands of words.
