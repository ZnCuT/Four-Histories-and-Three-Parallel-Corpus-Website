廉颇者，赵之良将也。
廉颇，是赵国杰出的将领。
Lian Po was an able general of Zhao.

赵惠文王十六年，廉颇为赵将伐齐，大破之，取阳晋，拜为上卿，以勇气闻于诸侯。
赵惠文王十六年（公元前283年），廉颇为赵国领兵攻打齐国，大败齐军，攻取了阳晋，被封为上卿，凭借自己的勇气闻名于诸侯。
In the sixteenth year of King Huiwen, he commanded the Zhao army against Qi and defeated its troops, taking the city of Yangjin. Then he was made a chief minister and was known for his prowess to all the states.

蔺相如者，赵人也，为赵宦者令缪贤舍人。
蔺相如，是赵国人，是赵国宦官头目缪贤的家臣。
Lin Xiangru, a man of Zhao, was the steward of Mu Xian, the chief eunuch.

赵惠文王时，得楚和氏璧。
赵惠文王时，得到了楚国的和氏璧。
King Huiwen of Zhao had come into possession of the jade of Bian He, a man of Chu.

秦昭王闻之，使人遗赵王书，愿以十五城请易璧。
秦昭王听说了，派人给赵王送了一封信，想用十五座城来换取和氏璧。
When King Zhao of Qin knew this, he sent an envoy with a letter to the king of Zhao, offering fifteen cities in exchange for the jade.

赵王与大将军廉颇诸大臣谋：欲予秦，秦城恐不可得，徒见欺；欲勿予，即患秦兵之来。
赵王和大将军廉颇等诸位大臣商量：想给秦国，而秦国的城池恐怕得不到，白白地被欺骗；想不给，又害怕秦军来攻打赵国。
The king took counsel with General Lian Po and his chief ministers, who feared that if the jade were sent to Qin they might be cheated and get no cities in return, yet if they refused the soldiers of Qin might attack.

计未定，求人可使报秦者，未得。
计谋还没有定下来，想寻找一个可以出使答复秦国的人，没有得到。
They could neither hit on a plan nor find an envoy to take their answer to Qin.

宦者令缪贤曰：“臣舍人蔺相如可使。”
宦官令缪贤说：“我的家臣蔺相如可以出使。”
Then Mu Xian, the chief eunuch, said, “My steward Lin Xiangru would make a good envoy.”

王问：“何以知之？”
赵王问他：“你怎么知道的？”
“How do you know?” asked the king.

对曰：“臣尝有罪，窃计欲亡走燕。臣舍人相如止臣曰：‘君何以知燕王？’”
回答说：“我曾经犯了罪，偷偷地计划想逃跑到燕国去。我的家臣蔺相如劝阻我，说：‘您凭借什么知道燕王会收留您呢？’”
He replied, “Once I did something wrong and secretly planned to escape to Yan, but my steward stopped me, asking, ‘How can you be sure of the king of Yan?’”

臣语曰：“臣尝从大王与燕王会境上，燕王私握臣手曰‘愿结友’。以此知之，故欲往。”
我回答说：“我曾经跟随大王和燕王在边境上会面，燕王私下里和我握手，说‘希望结成好朋友’。因此我知道燕王对我很友好，所以想去燕国。”
I answered, “I met the king of Yan at the frontier with our king, and he privately grasped my hand and offered me his friendship. That is how I know, and why I mean to go there.”

相如谓臣曰：“夫赵强而燕弱，而君幸于赵王，故燕王欲结于君。今君乃亡赵走燕，燕畏赵，其势必不敢留君，而束君归赵矣。君不如肉袒伏斧质请罪，则幸得脱矣。”
蔺相如对我说：“赵国强而燕国弱，而您受赵王宠幸，因此燕王对您很友好。如今您是从赵国逃到燕国去，燕国害怕赵国，势必不敢收留您，而会把您捆着送回赵国。您不如光着膀子伏在刀斧砧板上请罪，或许能够免罪。”
Lin said, “Zhao is strong and Yan is weak, and because you stood well with our lord the king of Yan desired your friendship. But if you now fly from Zhao to Yan, for fear of Zhao he will not dare to keep you and will have you sent back in chains. Your only possible way out is to bare your shoulder and prostrate yourself before the axe and block for punishment.”

臣从其计，大王亦幸赦臣。
我听从了他的计策，大王您也施恩赦免了我。
I took his advice and Your Majesty pardoned me.

臣窃以为其人勇士，有智谋，宜可使。”
我私下里认为这个人是勇士，而且有智谋，应该可以出使。”
To my mind he is a brave, resourceful man, well fitted to be our envoy.”

于是王召见，问蔺相如曰：“秦王以十五城请易寡人之璧，可予不？”
于是赵王召见他，问蔺相如说：“秦王想用十五座城来交换我的和氏璧，可以给他吗？”
The king thereupon summoned Lin Xiangru and asked him, “Should I accept the king of Qin's offer of fifteen cities in exchange for my jade?”

相如曰：“秦强而赵弱，不可不许。”
蔺相如说：“秦国强大而赵国弱小，不能不给。”
“Qin is strong, we are weak,” replied Lin Xiangru. “We cannot refuse.”

王曰：“取吾璧，不予我城，奈何？”
赵王说：“秦国拿了我的和氏璧，却不给我城池，怎么办？”
“What if he takes my jade but will not give me the cities?”

相如曰：“秦以城求璧而赵不许，曲在赵。赵予璧而秦不予赵城，曲在秦。均之二策，宁许以负秦曲。”
蔺相如说：“秦国用城换璧而赵国不答应，理亏的是赵国。而赵国给了和氏璧秦国却不给城，理亏的就是秦国了。比较两个方面，宁可答应秦国而使他们承担理亏的责任。”
“If we refuse Qin's offer of cities in exchange for the jade, that puts us in the wrong; but if we give up the jade and get no cities, that puts Qin in the wrong. Of these two courses, the better one is to agree and put Qin in the wrong.”

王曰：“谁可使者？”
赵王说：“谁可以出使？”
“Who can be our envoy?”

相如曰：“王必无人，臣愿奉璧往使。城入赵而璧留秦；城不入，臣请完璧归赵。”
蔺相如说：“大王如果真的没有人，我愿意捧着璧出使秦国。秦国的城划归了赵国，我就把璧留在秦国；秦国的城如果没有划归赵国，我一定完璧归赵。”
“If Your Majesty has no one else, I will gladly take the jade and go on this mission. If the cities are given to Zhao, the jade will remain in Qin. If no cities are given, I shall bring the jade back unscathed.”

赵王于是遂遣相如奉璧西入秦。
于是赵王就派遣蔺相如捧着和氏璧西行入秦。
So the king of Zhao sent Lin Xiangru with the jade west to Qin.

秦王坐章台见相如，相如奉璧奏秦王。
秦王坐在章台接见了蔺相如，蔺相如捧着和氏璧奏见秦王。
The king of Qin sat in his pleasure pavilion (Zhangtai) to receive Lin Xiangru, who presented the jade to him.

秦王大喜，传以示美人及左右，左右皆呼万岁。
秦王非常高兴，把和氏璧传给美人和手下人看，手下人都高呼万岁。
The king, very pleased, had it shown to his ladies and attendants, and all his attendants cheered.

相如视秦王无意偿赵城，乃前曰：“璧有瑕，请指示王！”
蔺相如看到秦王没有偿还给赵国城邑的意思，就走上前说：“璧有小斑点，请让我为大王指出来！”
Seeing that the king had no intention of giving any cities to Zhao, Lin Xiangru stepped forward and said, “There is a blemish on the jade. Let me show it to you, sir.”

王授璧。
秦王把璧给他。
As soon as the king gave him the jade.

相如因持璧却立，倚柱，怒发上冲冠，谓秦王曰：“大王欲得璧，使人发书至赵王，赵王悉召群臣议，皆曰‘秦贪，负其强以空言求璧，偿城恐不可得’。议不欲予秦璧。
于是蔺相如拿着璧倒退几步站住，靠着柱子，怒发冲冠，对秦王说：“大王想得到和氏璧，让人送信给赵王，赵王召集所有的臣下商量，都说‘秦国贪心，倚仗它的强大，用空话求璧，补偿城邑恐怕得不到’。想要不给秦国和氏璧。
Lin Xiangru retreated to stand with his back to a pillar. His hair bristling with fury, he said, “To get this jade, great king, you sent a letter to the king of Zhao. When our sovereign summoned his ministers to discuss the matter, they said, ‘Qin is greedy and, relying on its strength, hopes to get our jade in return for empty promises. We are not likely to receive the cities.’ They were against giving you the jade.

臣以为布衣之交尚不相欺，况大国乎！且以一璧之故，逆强秦之欢，不可。
我认为平民百姓的交往尚且不可以相互欺骗，何况堂堂大国呢！况且因为一块璧的原因而惹得秦国不高兴，不可取。
It seemed to me, however, that if even fellows in homespun can trust each other, how much more can powerful states. Besides, how wrong it would be to offend mighty Qin for the sake of a piece of jade!

于是赵王乃斋戒五日，使臣奉璧，拜送书于庭。何者？严大国之威以修敬也。”
因此赵王就斋戒五天，让我捧着璧，在朝堂上叩拜，送上国书。为什么呢？是尊敬大国的威严并表示敬意啊。”
So the king of Zhao, after fasting for five days, sent me with a letter and the jade to your court. Why? To show the respect and awe in which we hold your great country.”

今臣至，大王见臣列观，礼节甚倨；得璧，传之美人，以戏弄臣。臣观大王无意偿赵王城邑，故臣复取璧。大王必欲急臣，臣头今与璧俱碎于柱矣!”相如持其璧睨柱，欲以击柱。
现在我来了，大王在一般的宫殿里接待我，礼节很傲慢；拿到璧以后，传给美人看，来戏弄我。我看大王实在没有偿还赵国城邑的意愿，因此我又把璧取回来。大王如果一定要逼我的话，我的头今天就会和璧一起碎在这柱子上!”蔺相如拿着璧斜视着柱子，准备用璧击柱。
Yet on my arrival you received me in a pleasure pavilion and treated me with contempt. You took the jade and passed it among your ladies to make a fool of me. I can see you have no intention of giving Zhao those cities in return, so I have taken back the jade. If you use force against me, I will smash my head and the jade against this pillar.” With that, glancing at the pillar, he raised the jade and threatened to smash it.

秦王恐其破璧，乃辞谢固请，召有司案图，指从此以往十五都予赵。相如度秦王特以诈详为予赵城，实不可得，乃谓秦王曰：“和氏璧，天下所共传宝也，赵王恐，不敢不献。赵王送璧时，斋戒五日，今大王亦宜斋戒五日，设九宾于廷，臣乃敢上璧。”
秦王害怕他撞坏了璧，就道歉并再三请求，召集有司查看地图，指出从这里以外的十五座城给赵国。蔺相如揣摩秦王只不过是设计假装给赵国城邑，实际上赵国还是拿不到，于是就对秦王说：“和氏璧，是天下共同传扬的宝物，赵王害怕，不敢不献给秦。赵王送出璧时，斋戒了五天，如今大王也应该斋戒五天，设置九宾礼于朝廷，我才敢献上璧。”
To save the jade, the king of Qin apologized and begged him to stop, then ordered the officer in charge to look up the map and point out the boundaries of the fifteen cities to be given to Zhao. Lin Xiangru, thinking this was a subterfuge and that Zhao would never really get the cities, declared, “The jade of Bian He is a treasure known throughout the world, but for fear of Qin the king of Zhao dared not withhold it. Before parting with it he fasted for five days. So it is only right, great king, that you too should fast for five days and then prepare a grand court reception (the Nine Rites). Only then dare I hand it over.”

秦王度之，终不可强夺，遂许斋五日，舍相如广成传。相如度秦王虽斋，决负约不偿城，乃使其从者衣褐怀其璧，从径道亡，归璧于赵。
秦王揣度这件事，终究不可以强夺，于是答应斋戒五天，让蔺相如住在广成公馆。蔺相如估计秦王虽然斋戒，肯定会违背约定不给赵国城邑，于是让他的随从穿着粗布衣服，怀揣着和氏璧，从小道逃走，把和氏璧送回了赵国。
Since he could not seize the jade by force, the king agreed to fast for five days, during which time Lin Xiangru should be lodged in the Guangcheng Hostel. Lin Xiangru suspected that despite his fast the king would not keep his promise to give the cities. So, dressing one of his followers in rags and concealing the jade on his person, he made him hurry back to Zhao by paths and byways, returning the jade to Zhao.

秦王斋五日后，乃设九宾礼于庭，引赵使者蔺相如。相如至，谓秦王曰：“秦自穆公以来二十余君，未尝有坚明约束者也。臣诚恐见欺于王而负赵，故令人持璧归，间至赵矣。且秦强而赵弱，大王遣一介之使至赵，赵立奉璧来，今以秦之强而先割十五都予赵，赵岂敢留璧而得罪于大王乎? 臣知欺大王之罪当诛，臣请就汤镬，惟大王与群臣孰计议之!” 
秦王斋戒五天后，于是设九宾之礼于朝廷，接见赵国的使者蔺相如。蔺相如来到，对秦王说：“秦国自穆公以来二十多个君主，没有一个能够坚守盟约的。我实在害怕被大王欺骗而对不起赵国，所以让人把璧带回去了，如今已经从小路送回赵国了。况且秦国强大而赵国弱小，大王只派一个使者到赵国，赵国就立刻奉上了璧。现在秦国强大，却要先割让十五座城邑给赵国，赵国哪里敢私自留下和氏璧，从而得罪大王呢？我知道欺骗大王的罪当处死刑，我请求受汤镬之刑，但愿大王和群臣仔细商量这件事！” 
When the king of Qin had fasted for five days, he prepared a grand reception for Zhao’s envoy. Lin Xiangru, arriving, announced to the king: “Since the time of Duke Mu of Qin, not one of the twenty-odd princes of your state has kept faith. Fearful of being deceived by Your Majesty and letting my country down, I sent a man back with the jade. He should be in Zhao by now. Qin is strong and Zhao is weak. When you, great king, sent a single messenger to Zhao, we immediately brought the jade here. If your mighty state had first given us fifteen cities, we should not have dared offend you by keeping the jade. I know I deserve death for deceiving you and beg to be boiled in the cauldron. Consider this well with your ministers, great king!” 

秦王与群臣相视而嘻。左右或欲引相如去。秦王因曰：“今杀相如，终不能得璧也，而绝秦、赵之欢，不如因而厚遇之，使归赵，赵王岂以一璧之故欺秦邪!” 卒廷见相如，毕礼而归之。
秦王和群臣面面相觑，惊叹不已。左右有人想把蔺相如拖下去。秦王却说：“现在杀了蔺相如，终究也得不到璧，反而断绝了秦赵的友好，不如厚待他，让他回到赵国。赵王岂敢因为一块璧而欺骗秦国呢！” 于是就在朝廷上正式接见了蔺相如，行礼完毕后送他回国。
The king and all his ministers gaped at each other. Some attendants prepared to drag Lin Xiangru away, but the king said: “Killing him now will not get us the jade but would spoil our relations with Zhao. Better treat him handsomely and send him back. The king of Zhao dare not risk offending Qin for the sake of a piece of jade.” Thereupon he entertained Lin Xiangru in his court, dismissing him when the ceremony was over.

相如既归，赵王以为贤大夫使不辱于诸侯，拜相如为上大夫。秦亦不以城予赵，赵亦终不予秦璧。
蔺相如已经回到赵国，赵王认为他是贤能的大夫，出使诸侯而不受辱，任命他为上大夫。秦国也不给赵国城邑，赵国最终也不给秦国和氏璧。
The king of Zhao was so pleased with the skill with which Lin Xiangru had saved the state from disgrace that he made him a high councillor on his return. Neither did Qin give the cities to Zhao, nor did Zhao give the jade to Qin.

其后秦伐赵，拔石城。明年，复攻赵，杀二万人。秦王使使者告赵王，欲与王为好会于西河外渑池。赵王畏秦，欲毋行。廉颇、蔺相如计曰：“王不行，示赵弱且怯也。”赵王遂行，相如从。
之后秦国攻打赵国，攻占了石城。第二年，再攻打赵国，杀死二万人。秦王派使者告诉赵王，想和赵王在西河外的渑池会见言和。赵王害怕秦国，不想去。廉颇、蔺相如商量说：“大王不去，就表明赵国弱小而胆怯。”赵王于是前行，蔺相如跟从。
After this, Qin attacked Zhao and captured Shicheng. The following year, twenty thousand men of Zhao were killed in another attack. Then the king of Qin sent an envoy to the king of Zhao, proposing a friendly meeting at Minchi south of Xihe. The king of Zhao was reluctant to go, for fear of Qin. But Lian Po and Lin Xiangru reasoned with him, saying, “Not to go, sir, would make our country appear weak and cowardly.” So the king went, accompanied by Lin Xiangru.

廉颇送至境；与王诀曰：“王行，度道里会遇之礼毕，还，不过三十日。三十日不还，则请立太子为王，以绝秦望。”王许之，遂与秦王会渑池。
廉颇送他们到边境上，和赵王辞别道：“大王前去，估计路程及会见礼节完毕，直到回来，不会超过三十天。三十天后不回来，就请让我立太子为王，以断绝秦国的贪心。”赵王答应了他，就去同秦王在渑池相见。
Lian Po escorted them to the frontier and bade the king farewell, saying, “I reckon that Your Majesty’s journey, the meeting, and the return should not take more than thirty days. If you fail to return in that time, I suggest appointing the crown prince as king to thwart Qin’s designs.” The king agreed and went to meet the king of Qin at Minchi.

秦王饮酒酣，曰：“寡人窃闻赵王好音，请奏瑟。”赵王鼓瑟。秦御史前书曰：“某年月日，秦王与赵王会饮，令赵王鼓瑟。”蔺相如前曰：“赵王窃闻秦王善为秦声，请奏盆秦王，以相娱乐。”
秦王饮酒正酣，说：“我私下里听说赵王喜好音乐，请赵王弹瑟。”赵王弹瑟。秦国御史上前记载道：“某年某月某日，秦王与赵王一起饮酒，让赵王弹瑟。”蔺相如上前说：“赵王私下里听说秦王善于演奏秦声，请演奏盆声娱乐秦王。”
The king of Qin, merry after drinking, said, “I have privately heard that the king of Zhao enjoys music. Please play the cithern.” The king of Zhao played it. The Qin chronicler stepped forward and recorded, “On such-and-such a day, the king of Qin drank with the king of Zhao and ordered the king of Zhao to play the cithern.” Lin Xiangru then advanced and said, “The king of Zhao has privately heard that the king of Qin is skilled at Qin music, so he requests to play the pitcher-pitch tune to entertain the king.”

秦王怒，不许。于是相如前进緸，因跪请秦王。秦王不肯击瓴。
秦王发怒，不答应。于是蔺相如上前献上盆瓴，又跪着请求秦王演奏。秦王不肯击瓴。
The king of Qin angrily refused. But Lin Xiangru went forward with the pitcher and, kneeling, requested the king to play. The king still refused.

相如曰：“五步之内，相如请得以颈血溅大王矣!”左右欲刃相如，相如张目叱之，左右皆靡。
蔺相如说：“五步之内，我就要把脖子上的鲜血溅到大王身上了!”左右的人想要杀蔺相如，蔺相如瞪眼呵斥，他们都退开了。
Lin Xiangru said, “Within five steps, I shall spatter my own blood onto Your Majesty!” The attendants wanted to attack Lin Xiangru, but he glared at them and shouted, and they all shrank back.

于是秦王不怿，为一击瓴。相如顾召赵御史书曰：“某年月日，秦王为赵王击瓴。”
于是秦王不高兴，只敲了一下瓴。蔺相如回头召来赵国御史，记载道：“某年某月某日，秦王为赵王击瓴。”
The king of Qin, displeased, then struck the pitcher once. Lin Xiangru turned to summon the Zhao chronicler and recorded, “On such-and-such a date, the king of Qin played the pitcher for the king of Zhao.”

秦之群臣曰：“请以赵十五城为秦王寿!”蔺相如亦曰：“请以秦之咸阳为赵王寿!”
秦国群臣说：“请赵国用十五座城邑为秦王祝寿!”蔺相如也说：“请秦国用咸阳为赵王祝寿!”
The ministers of Qin said, “Let Zhao present fifteen cities to the king of Qin as a birthday gift!” Lin Xiangru replied, “Then let Qin present Xianyang to the king of Zhao as a birthday gift!”

秦王竟酒，终不能加胜于赵。赵亦盛设兵以待秦，秦不敢动。
整个酒宴结束，秦王始终不能压服赵国。赵国又布置重兵防备秦国，秦国因此不敢轻举妄动。
By the end of the banquet, the king of Qin had failed to dominate Zhao. Zhao had also deployed a strong army to guard against Qin, so Qin did not dare make a move.

既罢归国，以相如功大，拜为上卿，位在廉颇之右。
会见结束回到赵国后，赵王因蔺相如功劳卓著，任命他为上卿，职位在廉颇之上。
After returning to Zhao, the king appointed Lin Xiangru as chief minister for his great merit, placing him above Lian Po.

廉颇曰：“我为赵将，有攻城野战之大功，而蔺相如徒以口舌为劳，而位居我上，且相如素贱人，吾羞，不忍为之下。”
廉颇说：“我作为赵国将军，在攻城野战上有大功，而蔺相如只是凭口舌立功，却位居我之上，而且蔺相如本是卑贱之人，我觉得羞耻，不能容忍他的职位在我之上。”
Lian Po said, “I am a general of Zhao, with great achievements in siege and field battles, yet Lin Xiangru has only used his tongue to gain merit, and now ranks above me. Moreover, Lin Xiangru comes from a humble background. I feel ashamed and cannot tolerate being below him.”

宣言曰：“我见相如，必辱之。”相如闻，不肯与会。
并宣称：“我见到蔺相如，必定要羞辱他。”蔺相如听闻，不愿与廉颇同席。
He proclaimed, “If I see Lin Xiangru, I will humiliate him.” Lin Xiangru heard of this and refused to attend the same gatherings as Lian Po.

相如每朝时，常称病，不欲与廉颇争列。已而相如出，望见廉颇，相如引车避匿。
在每次朝会中，他常称病，不愿与廉颇争列。后来蔺相如出门，看见廉颇时，便引车避开隐藏。
At court, he often feigned illness to avoid competing with Lian Po for precedence. Later, when Lin Xiangru went out and saw Lian Po, he deliberately avoided him.

于是舍人相与谏曰：“臣所以去亲戚而事君者，徒慕君之高义也。今君与廉颇同列，廉君宣恶言而君畏匿之，恐惧殊甚，且庸人尚羞之，况于将相乎!臣等不肖，请辞去。”
于是他的舍人劝谏说：“我们离开亲戚而事奉君主，是因为仰慕君的高义。如今您与廉颇同列，而廉颇说恶言，您又畏惧隐藏，恐惧极大；即使是普通人都会感到羞耻，何况是将相呢？我们这些不才的臣子，请求辞去。”
Then his attendants advised, “We serve our lord only out of admiration for your high virtue. Now that you are ranked alongside Lian Po, and he speaks ill of you while you shrink in fear, the shame is extreme; even ordinary men would feel ashamed, let alone generals and ministers. We, your unworthy attendants, request to resign.”

蔺相如固止之，曰：“公之视廉将军孰与秦王?”曰：“不若也。”
蔺相如坚决阻止他们，说：“你们看廉颇将军和秦王，谁更厉害?”他们回答说：“秦王厉害。”
Lin Xiangru firmly stopped them and asked, “In your eyes, General Lian Po or the king of Qin, who is more powerful?” They replied, “The king of Qin is more powerful.”

相如曰：“夫以秦王之威，而相如廷叱之，辱其群臣，相如虽驽，独畏廉将军哉?
蔺相如说：“像秦王那样威风，我还当廷叱责他，羞辱他的臣子，我蔺相如虽然笨拙，难道单单害怕廉颇将军吗?
Lin Xiangru said, “If, useless as I am, I can rebuke the mighty king of Qin in court and insult his ministers, why should I be afraid of General Lian Po?

顾吾念之，强秦之所以不敢加兵于赵者，徒以吾两人在也。今两虎共斗，其势不俱生。
我这样考虑，是因为强大的秦国之所以不敢对赵用兵，只因为有我们两个人在。如今两虎发生争斗，势必不可能共存。
To my mind, the reason powerful Qin has not dared to attack Zhao is solely because of the two of us. Now if two tigers fight, both cannot survive.

吾所以为此者，以先国家之急而后私仇也。”
我之所以这样做，是把国家的安危放在前面，把私怨放在后面。”
I act as I do because I put the state’s urgent matters before personal grudges.”

廉颇闻之，肉袒负荆，因宾客至蔺相如门谢罪，曰：“鄙贱之人，不知将军宽之至此”
廉颇听说以后，光着膀子背着荆条，由宾客带着来到蔺相如家门口谢罪，说：“我是鄙贱之人，不知道将军能宽容至此。”
When Lian Po heard this, he bared his shoulders, fastened a thorned switch to his back, and, accompanied by his attendants, went to Lin Xiangru’s gate to apologize, saying, “Contemptible boor that I am, I did not understand your magnanimity, sir!”

卒相与欢，为刎颈之交。
终于相互和好，结成生死之交。
They became close friends, ready to die for each other.

是岁，廉颇东攻齐，破其一军。居二年，廉颇复伐齐幾,拔之。
那一年，廉颇向东攻打齐国，打败了齐国的一支军队。两年后，廉颇又攻打齐国的幾邑，并攻占它。
That year, Lian Po attacked Qi in the east and defeated one of its armies. Two years later he captured another city of Qi.

后三年，廉颇攻魏之防陵、安阳，拔之。后四年，蔺相如将而攻齐，至平邑而罢。
三年后，廉颇攻打魏国的防陵和安阳，并攻占它们。四年后，蔺相如率军攻打齐国，到平邑就撤军。
Three years later he stormed Fangling and Anyang in Wei and seized them. Four years later Lin Xiangru led an army against Qi but withdrew after reaching Pingyi.

其明年，赵奢破秦军阏与下。
第二年，赵奢在阏与城下击败了秦军。
The following year Zhao She defeated the Qin army at Yuyu.

赵奢者，赵之田部吏也。收租税而平原君家不肯出租，奢以法治之，杀平原君用事者九人。
赵奢是赵国负责田赋的官员。当平原君家不肯缴纳租税时，赵奢依法处理，杀掉了平原君家里管理事务的九个人。
Zhao She was an official in charge of land taxation in Zhao. When Lord Pingyuan’s family refused to pay taxes, Zhao She enforced the law and executed nine stewards.

平原君怒，将杀奢。奢因说曰：“君于赵为贵公子，今纵君家而不奉公则法削，法削则国弱，国弱则诸侯加兵。
平原君十分愤怒，想要杀赵奢。赵奢劝说道：“您在赵国是贵公子，如果纵容家族而不守公法，法律被削弱，则国家会衰弱，国家衰弱则诸侯会用兵攻击赵国。
Lord Pingyuan became angry and wanted to kill Zhao She. Zhao She reasoned with him, “You are a noble of Zhao, but if you let your family ignore the law, then the law is weakened, the state becomes weak, and other lords may invade.

诸侯加兵，是无赵也，君安得有此富乎?
一旦诸侯用兵，赵国就不复存在，您哪还有现在的财富呢?
If Zhao falls, how will you preserve your wealth?

以君之贵，奉公如法则上下平，上下平则国强，国强则赵固，而君为贵戚，岂轻于天下邪?”
以您的尊贵身份，依法办事，则国内上下公平，上下公平则国家强盛，国家强盛则赵国稳固，而您作为贵戚，也不会被天下轻视。”
If you, as a noble, follow the law, society will be just, the state strong, Zhao secure, and you as a royal relative will not be despised by the world.”

平原君以为贤，言之于王。王用之治国赋，国赋大平，民富而府库实。
平原君认为赵奢贤能，于是向赵王推荐他。赵王任命赵奢治理国家赋税，国家的赋税治理平稳，百姓富足，国库充实。
Impressed by Zhao She’s wisdom, Lord Pingyuan recommended him to the king, who put him in charge of taxation. Under Zhao She’s management, taxes were fairly collected, the people prospered, and the treasury was full.

秦伐韩，军于阏舆。
秦国攻打韩国，在阏舆驻军。
Then Qin invaded Han and stationed an army at Yuyu.

王召廉颇而问曰：“可救不?”对曰：“道远险狭，难救。”
赵王召来廉颇问：“可以救韩国吗?”廉颇回答说：“道路遥远，又险又窄，很难救。”
The king of Zhao summoned Lian Po and asked, “Can we go to their aid?” Lian Po replied, “The road is long and passes through dangerous, narrow terrain; it would be hard to rescue them.”

又召乐乘而问焉，乐乘对如廉颇言。

许历说：“秦军没想到赵军到此，他们气势汹汹，将军应集中兵力严阵以待，否则必败。”
Xu Li said, “The Qin army did not expect us to reach this far. Their morale is high. You must concentrate your troops to meet them, or we will be defeated.”

赵奢曰：“请受令。”
赵奢说：“我接受你的建议。”
Zhao She agreed.

许历曰：“请就铁质之诛。”

赵王因以括为将，代廉颇。
赵王于是任命赵括为将军，取代廉颇。
The king appointed Zhao Kuo to replace Lian Po.

蔺相如曰：“王以名使括，若胶柱而鼓瑟耳。括徒能读其父书传，不知合变也。”
蔺相如说：“大王只凭名声任用赵括，就像把琴柱粘死再弹琴一样（不知变通）。赵括只会读他父亲留下的兵书，却不懂得根据实际情况灵活应变。”

赵括的母亲问赵奢原因，赵奢说：“用兵打仗是生死攸关的事，而赵括却把它说得很轻松。如果赵国不用赵括当将军也就罢了，要是一定要用他，使赵军战败的人必定是赵括。”
When Zhao Kuo’s mother asked why, Zhao She said, “War is a matter of life and death, yet he speaks lightly. If Zhao does not appoint him, fine; if appointed, the army’s defeat will be his fault.”

及括将行，其母上书言于王曰：“括不可使将。”
等到赵括将要出征时，他的母亲向赵王上书说：“不能让赵括担任将军。”
Before Zhao Kuo’s departure, his mother wrote to the king urging him not to send him.

王曰：“何以?”
赵王问：“为什么？”
She explained that Zhao Kuo, unlike his father, treated officers with arrogance, appropriated royal gifts, and neglected duties. The king replied, “Mother, leave it; I have decided.”

对曰：“始妾事其父，当时为将，身所奉饭饮而进食者以百数，大王及宗室所赏赐者尽以予军吏士大夫，受命之日，不问家事。
赵括的母亲回答说：“当初我侍奉赵括的父亲，他当时担任将军，亲自捧着饭食招待的人有上百个，大王和宗室赏赐的东西，他全部分给军中官吏和士大夫；从接受任命的那天起，就不再过问家里的事。
She explained that Zhao Kuo, unlike his father, treated officers with arrogance, appropriated royal gifts, and neglected duties.

如今赵括刚当上将军，就面朝东接受军吏朝拜，军中官吏没有敢抬头看他的；大王赏赐的金银丝帛，他都带回家收藏起来，还每天留意便宜合适的田地房屋，能买的就买下来。
She explained that Zhao Kuo, unlike his father, treated officers with arrogance, appropriated royal gifts, and neglected duties.

王以为何如其父?父子异心，愿王勿遣!”

She explained that Zhao Kuo, unlike his father, treated officers with arrogance, appropriated royal gifts, and neglected duties.

王曰：“母置之，吾已决矣!”
赵王说：“老夫人别管了，我已经决定了！”
The king replied, “Mother, leave it; I have decided.”

括母因曰：“王终遣之，即有如不称，妾得无随坐乎?”
赵括的母亲于是说：“大王最终还是要派他出征，如果他有不称职的地方，我能不受牵连吗？”
She asked, “If he fails, may I be spared blame?”

客曰：“唉！君何见之晚也？夫天下以市道交，君有势，我则从君，君无势，则去。此固其理也，有可怨乎？”
门客说：“唉！您怎么明白得这么晚呢？天下人都是用市场交易的道理来交朋友的，您有权势，我们就跟随您；您没有权势，我们就离开。这本来就是常理，有什么可怨恨的呢？”
