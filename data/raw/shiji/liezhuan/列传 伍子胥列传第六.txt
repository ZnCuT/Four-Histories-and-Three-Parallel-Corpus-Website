伍子胥者，楚人也，名员。
伍子胥是楚国人，名员。
Wu Zixu, or Wu Yuan, was a native of Chu.

员父曰伍奢。员兄曰伍尚。
他的父亲叫伍奢，哥哥叫伍尚。
His father was Wu She, his elder brother Wu Shang.

其先曰伍举，以直谏事楚庄王，有显，故其后世有名于楚。
他的先祖叫伍举，曾因直言劝谏侍奉楚庄王，功业显达，所以他的后代在楚国有名望。
Their ancestor Wu Chu had been noted for his frank advice to King Zhuang of Chu, and so his descendants were well-known in that state.

楚平王有太子名曰建，使伍奢为太傅，费无忌为少傅。
楚平王有个太子名叫建，（平王）任命伍奢为太子太傅，费无忌为太子少傅。
King Ping of Chu appointed Wu She senior guardian to Crown Prince Jian, with Fei Wuji as junior guardian.

无忌不忠于太子建。
费无忌对太子建不忠诚。
Fei was not loyal to the prince, however.

平王使无忌为太子取妇于秦，秦女好，无忌驰归报平王曰：“秦女绝美，王可自取，而更为太子取妇。”
楚平王派费无忌到秦国为太子迎娶妻子，（看到）秦国女子容貌美丽，费无忌就快马赶回报告平王说：“秦国女子极其美貌，大王可以自己娶她，再给太子另娶妻子。”
Sent to Qin by the king to bring back a wife for the prince and finding her very lovely, he galloped back to report, "This girl from Qin is a marvellous beauty. Your Majesty had better take her yourself and find another wife for the crown prince.”

平王遂自取秦女而绝爱幸之，生子轸。更为太子取妇。
楚平王于是自己娶了秦国女子，并且极其宠爱她，和她生下儿子轸，又给太子另娶了妻子。
So King Ping took the girl, who became his favourite and gave birth to a son Zhen, while a different bride was found for the crown prince.

无忌既以秦女自媚于平王，因去太子而事平王。
费无忌凭借送秦女给平王这件事讨好平王后，就离开太子，去侍奉平王。
Since Fei had pleased the king in this matter, he left the crown prince and entered the king's service.

恐一旦平王卒而太子立，杀己，乃因谗太子建。
（费无忌）担心一旦平王去世、太子即位，会杀了自己，于是就趁机在平王面前诋毁太子建。
But fearing that when the king died and Jian ascended the throne he might be killed, he began to slander Jian.

建母，蔡女也，无宠于平王。
太子建的母亲是蔡国人，不受平王宠爱。
As the king did not love the crown prince's mother, who was from Cai.

平王稍益疏建，使建守城父，备边兵。
平王对太子建逐渐越来越疏远，派太子建驻守城父，防备边境的敌军。
he gradually became estranged from Jian, whom he sent to guard the frontier city of Chengfu.

顷之，无忌又日夜言太子短于王曰：“太子以秦女之故，不能无怨望，愿王少自备也。”
不久，费无忌又日夜在平王面前说太子的坏话：“太子因为秦国女子的缘故，不可能没有怨恨，希望大王稍加防备。”
Soon Fei was belittling Jian day and night to the king. "The crown prince naturally resents losing his bride from Qin," he said. “I must beg Your Majesty to be on your guard.”

无忌言于王曰：“自太子居城父，将兵，外交诸侯，且欲入为乱矣。”
费无忌对平王说：“自从太子驻守城父，统领军队后，在外结交诸侯，而且将要回都城叛乱了。”
"Now the prince is in command of an army at Chengfu and in contact with other states, he may make trouble."

平王乃召其太傅伍奢考问之。
平王于是召见太子的太傅伍奢，盘问他（太子的情况）。
King Ping summoned the senior guardian Wu She and asked him about it.

伍奢知无忌谗太子于平王，因曰：“王独奈何以谗贼小臣疏骨肉之亲乎？”
伍奢知道是费无忌在平王面前诋毁太子，于是说：“大王怎么能因为谗言害人的小人，就疏远亲生骨肉呢？”
Wu She, knowing of Fei's slander, told the king, "Don’t let yourself be estranged from your own flesh and blood, sir, by a petty treacherous slanderer."

无忌曰：“王今不制，其事成矣。王且见禽。”
费无忌说：“大王现在不制止（太子），他的阴谋就要成功了，大王将会被他擒获。”
Fei insisted, "Unless you stop them, they will succeed. And then you will be trapped.”

于是平王怒，囚伍奢，而使城父司马奋扬往杀太子。
于是平王发怒，囚禁了伍奢，又派城父的司马奋扬去杀太子。
So the king in his anger had Wu She imprisoned. He ordered Fen Yang, the military commander at Chengfu, to kill the crown prince.

行未至，奋扬使人先告太子：“太子急去，不然将诛。”
奋扬还没到（太子住处），就先派人告诉太子：“太子赶紧逃走，不然就会被杀死。”
but instead Fen Yang sent a man to warn Jian, saying, "Fly for your life, or you are lost!"

太子建亡奔宋。
太子建逃走，投奔了宋国。
So Prince Jian fled to Song.

无忌言于平王曰：“伍奢有二子，皆贤，不诛且为楚忧。可以其父质而召之，不然且为楚患。”
费无忌对平王说：“伍奢有两个儿子，都很有才能，不杀他们，将会成为楚国的祸患。可以用他们的父亲作人质召唤他们，不然终将成为楚国的灾难。”
Fei Wuji told the king, "Wu She has two sons, both able. If you do not eliminate them they will cause Chu trouble. With their father as hostage you can summon them. Failing this, they will be a menace to our state."

王使使谓伍奢曰：“能致汝二子则生，不能则死。”
平王派人对伍奢说：“能把你的两个儿子招来，你就能活；不能招来，你就会死。”
Then the king sent word to Wu She, “Get your two sons here and you shall live. Otherwise you die.”

伍奢曰：“尚为人仁，呼必来。员为人刚戾忍询，能成大事，彼见来之并禽，其势必不来。”
伍奢说：“伍尚为人仁慈，叫他来，他一定会来；伍员为人刚烈乖戾，能忍受屈辱，能成就大事，他看出（来这里）会和我一起被擒，按情势一定不会来。”
"Shang has a good heart and would come," replied Wu She. “But Zixu has a hard character, can stand abuse and is capable of great things. When he sees this is a trap, he will not come.”

王不听，使人召二子曰：“来，吾生汝父；不来，今杀奢也。”
平王不信，派人去对伍氏兄弟说：“如果你们来了，我就放了你们的父亲；如果你们不来，我就立刻把你们的父亲杀掉。”
The king paid no attention but sent for both sons, saying, “Come, and your father lives. Otherwise he must die.”

伍尚欲往，员曰：“楚之召我兄弟，非欲以生我父也，恐有脱者后生患，故以父为质，诈召二子。二子到，则父子俱死。何益父之死？往而令仇不得报耳。不如奔他国，借力以雪父之耻，俱灭，无为也。”
伍尚一听马上想回去。伍员说：“楚王之所以叫我们回去，并不是想给我们父亲留下活命，而是怕我们跑了，以后给他们闹乱子，所以才用父亲作人质，来骗我们。如果我们回去，就只有父子三人一起被杀。这对于父亲的死又有什么好处呢？白白地落一个没有人给父亲报仇。还不如我们一起逃奔别的国家，向别的国家借兵来给父亲报仇。回去和父亲一块死，有什么意义呢？”
Shang wanted to obey the summons but Zixu reasoned, "The king has no intention of sparing our father but has sent for us because he is afraid of the trouble we may cause if we escape. He is holding our father as hostage in order to trick us. If we go we shall all die together what good would that do our father? We should simply lose all chance of revenge. No, better escape to another state and enlist support to avenge him. There is no point in perishing together."

伍尚曰：“我知往终不能全父命。然恨父召我以求生而不往，后不能雪耻，终为天下笑耳。”
伍尚说：“我也知道回去救不了父亲，但我怕的是今天父亲叫我回去我没有回去，日后我也没有给父亲报仇，结果落一个被天下人耻笑。”
"I know I cannot save him by going," Shang rejoined. “But I don't want to be sneered at by the whole world for staying away to save my own skin and perhaps failing later to avenge him."

谓员：“可去矣！汝能报杀父之仇，我将归死。”
他对伍员说：“你可以逃走！因为你日后肯定能报这场杀父之仇，我准备回去和父亲一道死。”
He added, "You leave! You can avenge our father while I die with him."

尚既就执，使者捕伍胥。伍胥贯弓执矢向使者，使者不敢进，伍胥遂亡。
说罢伍尚遂束手被擒了。来人又想逮捕伍子胥。伍子胥弯弓搭箭，对准来人，来人不敢靠近，伍子胥乘势逃走了。
With Shang in their hands, the messengers tried to seize Zixu, but he fitted an arrow to his bow and aimed it at them so that they dared not advance. Thus he escaped.

闻太子建之在宋，往从之。
他听说太子建这时正逃亡在宋国，于是他也去了宋国。
Hearing that the crown prince was in Song, he went there to join him.

奢闻子胥之亡也，曰：“楚国君臣且苦兵矣。”
伍奢听说伍子胥逃跑了，感叹地说：“楚国的君臣们将来要吃兵火之苦了。”
When Wu She learned of Zixu's flight he said, "Now the king of Chu and his ministers face military disaster.”

伍尚至楚，楚并杀奢与尚也。
伍尚被押到郢都后，楚王把伍奢和伍尚都杀掉了。
As soon as Shang returned, he was put to death with his father.

伍胥既至宋，宋有华氏之乱，乃与太子建俱奔于郑。
伍子胥逃到宋国后，正赶上华亥等人发动叛乱，于是伍子胥就和太子建一起离开了宋国转到了郑国。
After Wu Zixu reached Song there was a revolt led by Hua Hai, so Wu Zixu and Prince Jian went on to Zheng.

郑人甚善之。
郑国人对他们很好。
where they were well received.

太子建又适晋，晋顷公曰：“太子既善郑，郑信太子。太子能为我内应，而我攻其外，灭郑必矣。灭郑而封太子。”
后来太子建到晋国访问，晋顷公对太子建说：“你和郑国的关系好，郑国人相信你，如果你能为我做内应，我从外面往里打，就一定可以灭掉郑国。灭郑国后，我就把那块地盘封给你，立你为君。”
Then Prince Jian visited Jin. Duke Qing of Jin said, "You are a good friend of Zheng and trusted there. If you help from within while I attack from without, I can certainly conquer Zheng and give it to you.”

太子乃还郑。
太子答应后返回了郑国。
The prince returned to Zheng.

事未会，会自私欲杀其从者，从者知其谋，乃告之于郑。
事情还没办，恰巧赶上太子想杀他的一个侍从，而这个侍从知道太子勾结晋国企图灭郑的阴谋，于是就逃出来把事情报告了郑国。
But before the plan was carried out he made an attempt on the life of one of his followers against whom he had a grudge, and this man, knowing the plot, informed against him.

郑定公与子产诛杀太子建。
郑定公和大夫子产一听立刻就把太子建抓起来杀掉了。
Then Duke Ding of Zheng and his minister Zichan killed Prince Jian.

建有子名胜。
这时太子建有个儿子名胜。
The prince had left a son named Sheng.

伍胥惧，乃与胜俱奔吴。
伍子胥害怕受牵连，就和太子的儿子胜一起逃到了吴国。
with whom Wu Zixu fled in alarm to Wu.

到昭关，昭关欲执之。伍胥遂与胜独身步走，几不得脱。
中途经过楚、吴交界的昭关时，昭关的守吏想逮捕他们，伍子胥和太子的儿子胜只好丢弃了车马从人，单身步行，差点被人家逮住。
The guards at the Zhao Pass tried to arrest them and, being on foot, they were very nearly caught.

追者在后。
追兵一直在后边跟着。
With pursuers hot behind them.

至江，江上有一渔父乘船，知伍胥之急，乃渡伍胥。
伍子胥逃到江边，见江上有一个渔父摇船。渔父知道伍子胥正急着避难，于是就把他渡了过去。
they reached the river, where a fisherman who saw that their case was desperate ferried them across in his boat.

伍胥既渡，解其剑曰：“此剑直百金，以与父。”
伍子胥过江后，解下了身上的佩剑，对渔父说：“这把宝剑价值百金，我把它送给你吧。”
On the further shore, Wu Zixu unbuckled his sword. "This sword, worth a hundred gold pieces, I leave with you," he said.

父曰：“楚国之法，得伍胥者赐粟五万石，爵执珪，岂徒百金剑邪！”不受。
渔父说：“楚国早有悬赏，谁能抓到伍子胥，赏给他粮食五万石，赐爵为‘执珪’，那些难道只值百金吗？”渔父没有接受伍子胥的酬谢。
The fisherman answered, "A reward of fifty thousand piculs of grain and a noble title has been offered in Chu to the man who captures Wu Zixu. Why should I take a sword worth only a hundred gold pieces?” And he refused it.

伍胥未至吴而疾，止中道，乞食。
伍子胥还没到达吴国首都就病倒了，半道上只好停下来，以乞讨为生。
On the way to Wu, Wu Zixu fell ill and had to stop to beg for food.

至于吴，吴王僚方用事，公子光为将。
伍子胥终于到达了吴国首都，吴国当时正是王僚执政，公子光为将军。
When he reached Wu, King Liao was on the throne with Lord Guang as his commander.

伍胥乃因公子光以求见吴王。
于是，伍子胥就通过公子光见到了吴王。
and through him Wu Zixu obtained an audience with the king.

久之，楚平王以其边邑钟离与吴边邑卑梁氏俱蚕,两女子争桑相攻，乃大怒，至于两国举兵相伐。
过了很长一段时间，楚国边境钟离县的女子和邻境吴国卑梁邑的女子因为养蚕采桑发生了殴斗，进而发展成了楚、吴两个国家的边境战争。
Some time later, the women raising silkworms in Wu's frontier town of Beiliangshi started fighting about mulberry leaves with those in Chu's frontier town Zhongli. King Ping of Chu was so incensed by this that he called out his troops, and the king of Wu sent troops to attack Chu too.

伍子胥说吴王僚曰：“楚可破也。愿复遣公子光。”
这时伍子胥对吴王僚说：“看此情形，可以打败楚国。大王可以派公子光再次出兵。”
Wu Zixu advised the king, “Chu can be defeated if you send Lord Guang out on another expedition.”

公子光谓吴王曰：“彼伍胥父兄为戮于楚，而劝王伐楚者，欲以自报其雠耳。伐楚未可破也。”
公子光说：“伍子胥的父亲、哥哥都是被楚王杀的，他劝大王伐楚，是为了给他的家族报仇。楚国现在是难以打败的。”
But Lord Guang told the king, "Wu Zixu's father and brother were killed in Chu. He is advising you to attack because he wants revenge. We cannot defeat Chu."

伍胥知公子光有内志,欲杀王而自立，未可说以外事，乃进专诸于公子光,退而与太子建之子胜耕于野。
伍子胥知道公子光有个人野心，他是想杀掉吴王而自立，在这种情况下，不可能劝他对外用兵，于是找来了一个勇士名叫专诸，把他推荐给公子光，而后自己就和太子建的儿子胜去隐居农耕，徐以待变了。
Wu Zixu knew that Lord Guang was plotting to kill the king and take his place, and that therefore it was useless to speak to him about matters outside. So he introduced Zhuan Zhu to Lord Guang and went into retirement himself ploughing the fields with Sheng, the son of Prince Jian.

五年而楚平王卒。
五年后，楚平王死了。
Five years later King Ping of Chu died.

初，平王所夺太子建秦女生子轸，及平王卒，轸竟立为后，是为昭王。

二子对曰：“楚将囊瓦贪，而唐、蔡皆怨之。王必欲大伐之，必先得唐、蔡乃可。”
两人回答说：“楚国将领囊瓦贪婪，唐国、蔡国都怨恨他。大王如果一定要大举攻打楚国，必须先争取到唐国、蔡国的支持才行。”
"Chu's commander, Lord Nang, is a grasping man," they replied, "and both Tang and Cai bear him a grudge. If you want to attack in strength, first win over Tang and Cai."

阖庐听之，悉兴师与唐、蔡伐楚，与楚夹汉水而阵。

“You were King Ping's subject, serving him as your lord, yet now you go so far as to defile the dead. Surely this is utterly counter to the laws of Heaven?”

伍子胥说：“替我向申包胥致歉，我已日暮途远，所以只能违背常理行事。”

吴王准备答应他。伍子胥劝谏说：“越王为人能忍受艰辛。现在大王不消灭他，以后一定会后悔。”

吴王不听（伍子胥的劝谏），采用太宰伯嚭的计策，和越国讲和。

Five years later King Fucha heard that Duke Jing of Qi had died and that the new king was weak, with his ministers contending for power. He raised an army to march north and attack Qi.

伍子胥谏曰：“句践食不重味，吊死问疾，且欲有所用之也。此人不死，必为吴患。”
伍子胥劝谏说：“勾践吃饭不吃两道菜，悼念死者、慰问病人，是想将来利用百姓。这个人不死，一定会成为吴国的祸患。”
Wu Zixu advised against this expedition, saying, "King Goujian eats only one dish at each meal. He mourns his dead subjects and shows concern for the sick. This means that he intends to use his men for some purpose. So long as he lives, he is a menace to us."

伍子胥谏曰：“今吴之有越，犹人之有腹心疾也。而王不先越而乃务齐，不亦谬乎！”
伍子胥劝谏说：“现在吴国拥有越国（这个隐患），就像人有心腹疾病一样。可是大王不先对付越国，却致力于攻打齐国，不也很荒谬吗！”

伍子胥谏曰：“夫越，腹心之病，今信其浮辞诈伪而贪齐。破齐，譬犹石田，无所用之。”
伍子胥劝谏说：“越国是（吴国的）心腹之患，现在（大王）相信它浮夸虚假的言辞，却贪图攻打齐国。打败齐国，就像得到石头地一样，没有什么用处。”
Once more Wu Zixu warned, "Yue is a cancer in our stomach, yet now trusting their empty, deceitful promises you mean to invade Qi. Even if you conquer Qi, it will be as useless to us as a stony field."

伍子胥谏曰：“且《盘庚之诰》曰：‘有颠越不恭，劓殄灭之，俾无遗育，无使易种于兹邑。’此商之所以兴。”
伍子胥劝谏说：“况且《盘庚之诰》里说：‘有狂傲不恭的人，就彻底消灭他们，让他们没有后代留存，不要让他们在这地方繁衍后代。’这是商朝兴盛的原因。”
"The Admonition of Pangeng says, 'An unruly and insolent people should be wiped out, leaving no remnants, no seeds of trouble sown in the land.' This was how the Shang Dynasty prospered."

伍子胥谏曰：“愿王释齐而先越；若不然，后将悔之无及。”
伍子胥劝谏说：“希望大王放弃攻打齐国，先对付越国；如果不这样，以后后悔就来不及了。”
"I entreat you to give up Qi and deal first with Yue, before it is too late for anything but regret."

而吴王不听，使子胥于齐。
但吴王不听，派伍子胥出使齐国。
The king, instead of listening to him, sent him on a mission to Qi.

子胥临行，谓其子曰：“吾数谏王，王不用，吾今见吴之亡矣。汝与吴俱亡，无益也。”
伍子胥临走时，对他的儿子说：“我多次劝谏大王，大王不采纳，我现在已预见吴国要灭亡了。你和吴国一起灭亡，没有好处。”
Just before he left, he told his son, "The king has turned a deaf ear to all my warnings. I can see that Wu will fall, but there is no need for you to fall with Wu."

乃属其子于齐鲍牧，而还报吴。
（伍子胥）就把他的儿子托付给齐国的鲍牧，然后返回吴国复命。
He entrusted his son to Bao Mu of Qi, after which he returned alone to Wu to report on his mission.

吴太宰嚭既与子胥有隙，因谗曰：“子胥为人刚暴，少恩，猜贼，其怨望恐为深祸也。”
吴国太宰伯嚭已经和伍子胥有嫌隙，就趁机诋毁说：“伍子胥为人刚强凶暴，缺少恩惠，多疑狠毒，他心怀怨恨，恐怕会成为大祸害。”
Since Bo Pi bore Wu Zixu a grudge he slandered him to the king, saying, "Wu Zixu is stubborn, hot-tempered, heartless and suspicious. His resentment may lead to serious trouble."

谗曰：“前日王欲伐齐，子胥以为不可，王卒伐之而有大功。子胥耻其计谋不用，乃反怨望。”
（伯嚭）诋毁说：“前些天大王想攻打齐国，伍子胥认为不可以，大王最终攻打齐国并立下大功。伍子胥因自己的计谋没被采用而感到羞耻，反而心怀怨恨。”
"When you decided to attack Qi he was against it, and when your expedition was so successful he felt humiliated at having his advice passed over and became an embittered man."

谗曰：“而今王又复伐齐，子胥专愎强谏，沮毁用事，徒幸吴之败以自胜其计谋耳。”
（伯嚭）诋毁说：“如今大王又要攻打齐国，伍子胥专横固执、强行劝谏，败坏阻挠国家大事，只是希望吴国战败，来证明自己的计谋正确罢了。”
"Now that you are going to attack Qi again, Wu Zixu is so set against it that he is undermining our efforts in the hope that we will fail, and thus prove him right."

谗曰：“今王自行，悉国中武力以伐齐，而子胥谏不用，因辍谢，详病不行。王不可不备，此起祸不难。”
（伯嚭）诋毁说：“现在大王亲自出征，发动全国的兵力攻打齐国，可伍子胥的劝谏没被采纳，就推辞不去，假装生病不上战场。大王不能不防备他，他发动祸乱是不难的。”
"You are going to lead the campaign in person with all the armed forces of the state, yet Wu Zixu, because his advice was disregarded, has excused himself from going on the pretext of illness. Be very vigilant, sir! He could easily start a rebellion."

谗曰：“且嚭使人微伺之，其使于齐也，乃属其子于齐之鲍氏。”
（伯嚭）诋毁说：“况且我派人暗中监视他，他出使齐国时，竟把他的儿子托付给齐国的鲍氏。”
"Besides, I have sent men to watch his movements. When he went on that mission to Qi, he entrusted his son to a family there named Bao."

谗曰：“夫为人臣，内不得意，外倚诸侯，自以为先王之谋臣，今不见用，常鞅鞅怨望。愿王早图之。”
（伯嚭）诋毁说：“作为臣子，在国内不如意，就向外依附诸侯，自认为是先王的谋臣，现在不被重用，就常常心怀不满。希望大王早点想办法对付他。”
"He is your subject, yet in his dissatisfaction he has found a protector elsewhere. He is always complaining that he was your father's adviser but is now no longer trusted. I hope you will take steps against him in good time."

吴王曰：“微子之言，吾亦疑之。” 乃使使赐伍子胥属镂之剑，曰：“子以此死。”
吴王夫差说：“即使你不说这些话，我自己也早就怀疑他了。” 于是就派人给伍子胥送去一把名叫 “属镂” 的宝剑，说：“你就用这把剑来自杀吧。”
The king said, "I had my suspicions before you spoke." He sent a messenger to give Wu Zixu his sword Shulou with the order, "You may kill yourself with this.”

伍子胥仰天叹曰：“嗟乎！谗臣豁为乱矣，王乃反诛我。我令若父霸。自若未立时，诸公子争立，我以死争之于先王，几不得立。若既得立，欲分吴国予我，我顾不敢望也。然今若听谀臣言以杀长者。”
伍子胥接过剑仰天长叹说：“唉！本来是奸臣伯嚭误国作乱，可是大王却反而杀我。我曾经辅助你的父亲在诸侯中称霸，在你还没有即位的时候，许多弟兄都争夺过这个王位，是我在先王面前誓死保你，才让你勉强继承王位。你当了吴王之后，想把吴国分一半给我，我都没有要。没想到今天你听信小人的坏话，反而来杀我。”
Wu Zixu cast up his eyes to heaven and sighed. “Ah, that slanderer Bo Pi is plotting treason, but you, my king, are punishing me instead! I made your father a mighty conqueror. Before you came to the throne many princes were contending for it, and had I not fought for you with the last king you would never have been enthroned. After you became king you offered me half your kingdom, but I declined. Now, taken in by the words of a flatterer, you are killing your senior statesman.”

乃告其舍人曰：“必树吾墓上以梓，令可以为器；而抉吾眼悬吴东门之上，以观越寇之入灭吴也。” 乃自刭死。
于是回头告诉他手下的人们说：“你们要在我的墓前种几棵梓树，让它长大了可以作棺材，还要把我的眼珠挖下来挂在吴国国都的东门，我要看着有朝一日越国人从这里进来灭掉吴国。” 说完就自刎而死了。
He instructed his steward, "Plant catalpas over my grave to provide a coffin for the king in time to come. Pluck out my eyes and hang them over the East Gate to see when the Yue invaders break through and destroy our state.” With that he cut his throat.

吴王闻之大怒，乃取子胥尸盛以鸱夷革，浮之江中。吴人怜之，为立祠于江上，因命曰胥山。
吴王听到了伍子胥死前的这番话非常生气，他叫人把伍子胥的尸体装进了一条皮口袋，把它扔进了江里。吴国人对伍子胥十分同情，便在江边为他立了一座庙，并把附近的一座小山称为胥山。
These words so enraged the king that he had Wu Zixu's corpse stuffed in a leather sack and thrown into the river. The men of Wu, grieving over Wu Zixu, built a temple to him by the river and renamed the hill there Mount Zixu.

吴王既诛伍子胥，遂伐齐。齐鲍氏杀其君悼公而立阳生。吴王欲讨其贼，不胜而去。
吴王杀掉了伍子胥之后便北上伐齐。这时正好齐国的鲍氏杀了齐悼公而另立了公子阳生为君。吴国想抱打不平地讨伐鲍氏，结果没能取胜，只好退兵了。
After killing Wu Zixu, King Fucha set out on his expedition against Qi. The Bao clan of Qi killed Duke Dao and set up Yangsheng in his place, but King Fucha failed to crush their rebellion and withdrew.

其后二年，吴王召鲁卫之君会之橐皋。
又过了两年，吴国召集鲁国、卫国的国君在橐皋会盟。
Two years later he summoned the princes of Lu and Wei to a conference at Tuogao.

其明年，因北大会诸侯于黄池，以令周室。
第二年，吴王又率兵北上，大会各国诸侯于黄池，并借以要挟周王室。
The following year he went north and held a great conference with the heads of all the states at Huangchi, posing as the protector of Zhou.

越王句践袭杀吴太子，破吴兵。吴王闻之，乃归，使使厚币与越平。
不料想越王句践这时乘虚带兵袭击吴国，杀死了吴国的太子，打败吴国的军队。吴王夫差闻讯后，只好由黄池赶回，并派人带着厚礼去与越国求和了。
Then King Goujian of Yue launched a sudden attack, killed the crown prince of Wu and routed Wu's army. When King Fucha heard this he went back, sending envoys with rich gifts to sue for peace.

后九年，越王句践遂灭吴，杀王夫差，而诛太宰豁，以不忠于其君，而外受重赂，与己比周也。
又过了九年，越王句践终于灭掉了吴国，杀死了吴王夫差，同时也杀掉了吴国的太宰伯嚭，因为他不忠于自己的国君，接受外人的贿赂，与敌国狼狈为奸。
Nine years later King Goujian destroyed Wu and killed King Fucha. He also put to death the chief minister Bo Pi because he had been disloyal to his sovereign, collaborated with another state and considered only his own selfish interests.

伍子胥初所与俱亡故楚太子建之子胜者，在于吴。
当初和伍子胥一起逃出来的原楚国太子建的儿子胜，也一直住在吴国。
Wu Zixu, at his first coming to Wu, had been accompanied by Sheng, son of Crown Prince Jian, who had also fled from Chu.

当吴王夫差在位时，楚王曾想叫他回去。
During the reign of Fucha of Wu, King Hui of Chu wanted to recall Sheng.

叶公谏曰:“胜好勇而阴求死士,殆有私乎!”
但叶公劝谏说：“胜这个人勇敢好斗，而且还暗中收养了许多亡命之徒，他别是有什么阴谋吧!"
but the lord of Ye advised against it, saying, "Sheng sets store by military prowess and is quietly assembling men ready to die for him. He may be plotting something.”

惠王不听。遂召胜，使居楚之边邑鄢,号为白公。
楚惠王不听，终于还是把他叫回来了，让他住在楚的边城鄢邑，号为白公。

白公胜回国后的第五年，他请求国家出兵伐郑，楚国的令尹子西答应了他的请求。
Five years later he asked permission to attack Zheng and the chief minister Zixi agreed.

兵未发而晋伐郑，郑请救于楚。
谁知楚军还没派出而晋国已经出兵伐郑了，郑国派人向楚国求救。
But before the expedition set out, Zheng was invaded by Jin and begged Chu for aid.

楚使子西往救，与盟而还。
楚王派子西前去救郑，子西去后与郑国结盟而回。
Then Chu sent Zixi to the rescue, and he returned after making a pact with Zheng.

白公胜怒曰：“非郑之仇，乃子西也。”
白公胜见此情景心中大怒，说：“如今我的仇人已经不是郑国，而是子西了。”
The lord of Bai was angry and declared, "It seems Zixi is my enemy, not Zheng!"

胜自砺剑,人问曰：“何以为?”
于是他就自己霍霍磨剑，有人问他：“你磨剑干什么?”
He whetted his sword and, when asked the reason.

胜曰：“欲以杀子西。”
白公胜说：“杀子西。”
replied, "This is to kill Zixi!"

子西闻之，笑曰：“胜如卵耳，何能为也。”
子西听了笑着说：“白公胜像个鸡蛋，一碰就破，他能干什么。”
When Zixi heard this he said with a laugh, "That egg-shell Sheng, what can he do to me?”

其后四岁,白公胜与石乞袭杀楚令尹子西、司马子綦于朝。
四年后的一天，白公胜和石乞乘着上朝的机会发动突然袭击，一举杀死了楚国的令尹子西与司马子綦。

石乞曰：“不杀王，不可。”乃劫王如高府。
石乞对白公胜说：“不把楚王一起杀掉，恐怕不行。”于是就劫持着楚惠王一起向高府转移。
Then Shi Qi said, “We must kill the king as well.” They pursued the king, who fled to the Gao Mansion.

石乞从者屈固负楚惠王亡走昭夫人之宫。
不想石乞的随从屈固，偷偷地背着楚惠王逃到惠王的母亲昭王夫人的宫中去了。
One of Shi Qi's retainers, Qu Gu, carried the king on his back to the queen mother's palace.

外面的叶公听说白公在朝内发动了叛乱，便率领着他的属下讨伐白公。

石乞曰：“事成为卿，不成而亨，固其职也。”
石乞说：“事成了当卿，事败了受烹，本来就理当如此。”
"Had we succeeded," replied Shi Qi, "I should have been a high minister. Now that we have failed, it is my duty to die in the cauldron.”

终不肯告其尸处。
到末了他也没有说出白公的尸首在什么地方。
He refused to say where his lord had died.

遂亨石乞，而求惠王，复立之。
于是叶公下令烹了石乞，而后又找出了楚惠王让他恢复了王位。
so he was boiled alive. Then they found King Hui and restored him to the throne.

太史公曰：怨毒之于人甚矣哉!

The Grand Historian comments: How deeply resentment rankles in men's hearts!

王者尚不能行之于臣下，况同列乎!
君主尚且不能对臣下施加（过分的怨恨），何况同僚之间呢！
A ruler cannot afford to offend his subjects, much less one of his peers.

向令伍子胥从奢俱死，何异蝼蚁。

白公如果不图谋自立为君，他的功业和谋略也多得说不完啊！
If the lord of Bai had not aspired to the throne, his practical achievements and good advice would also have been remarkable.
