In the twenty-sixth year of the First Emperor (221 BC), because of the distinguished service rendered by his family for succeeding generations, Meng Tian was appointed a Qin general. He attacked Qi, inflicting a major defeat, and was honoured with the post of prefect of the capital.

秦已并天下，乃使蒙恬将三十万众北逐戎狄，收河南。
秦国已经统一天下后，就派蒙恬率领三十万大军向北驱逐戎狄，收复了黄河以南的土地。
Qin, having completed its unification of the empire, dispatched Meng Tian to lead a force of 300,000 men and advance north, expelling the Rong and Di barbarians and taking control of the region south of the bend of the Yellow River.

筑长城，因地形，用制险塞，起临洮，至辽东，延袤万余里。
（蒙恬）修筑长城，依据地形，设置险要关塞，长城从临洮开始，延伸到辽东，绵延一万多里。
He set about constructing the Great Wall, following the contours of the land and utilizing the narrow defiles to set up frontier posts. The wall began at Lintao and ran east to Liaodong, extending for a distance of over 10,000 li.

于是渡河，据阳山，逶蛇而北。

At this time Meng Tian’s might had struck terror into the Xiongnu people.

始皇甚尊宠蒙氏，信任贤之。
秦始皇非常尊重宠爱蒙氏家族，信任并认为他们贤能。
The First Emperor treated the members of the Meng family with extreme favour, trusting them and assigning them to office because of their worth.

而亲近蒙毅，位至上卿，出则参乘，入则御前。
（秦始皇）尤其亲近蒙毅，蒙毅的官位升到上卿，（蒙毅）外出时就陪皇帝同乘一辆车，入朝后就侍奉在皇帝身边。
He was particularly close to Meng Yi, who advanced to the position of a chief minister. Outside the palace, Meng Yi rode in the same carriage as the emperor; at court he stood in the imperial presence.

恬任外事而毅常为内谋，名为忠信，故虽诸将相莫敢与之争焉。
蒙恬负责朝廷外部的事务，而蒙毅常常在朝中参与谋划，（他们）以忠诚守信闻名，因此即使是朝中的各位将军和丞相，也没有人敢和他们相争。
Meng Tian was entrusted with affairs on the foreign front, while Meng Yi constantly took part in the planning of internal affairs, and both enjoyed a reputation for loyalty and good faith. As a result, none of the other generals or high ministers dared to compete with them.

赵高者，诸赵疏远属也。
赵高是赵国王族的远房亲属。
Zhao Gao belonged to a distant branch of the various families of the Zhao surname.

赵高昆弟数人，皆生隐宫，其母被刑缪，世世卑贱。
赵高兄弟几人，都出生在隐宫（古代罚作宫刑的人所居之处），他的母亲受过刑罚，（因此他家）世世代代地位卑贱。
He had several younger brothers, all of whom were born in prison, his mother having been condemned to punishment. His family had thus for generations been lowly and humble.

秦王闻高强力，通于狱法，举以为中车府令。
秦始皇听说赵高办事勤勉有力，通晓刑狱法律，就提拔他担任中车府令。
The First Emperor, having heard that Zhao Gao was diligent and well versed in legal matters, appointed him as chief of the office of palace carriages.

高即私事公子胡亥，喻之决狱。

帝以高之敦于事也，赦之，复其官爵。
秦始皇因为赵高办事勤勉，赦免了他，恢复了他的官职和爵位。
But because Zhao Gao was so knowledgeable in the handling of affairs, the emperor pardoned him and restored him to office.

始皇欲游天下，道九原，直抵甘泉，乃使蒙恬通道，自九原抵甘泉，堑山堙谷，千八百里。道未就。
秦始皇想巡游天下，计划经过九原，直达甘泉。于是派蒙恬开辟道路，从九原到甘泉，开山填谷，全长一千八百里。这条道路尚未完工。
The First Emperor was about to set out on a tour of the empire, proceeding through Jiuyuan and going directly to Sweet Springs. He accordingly ordered Meng Tian to construct a road that would run directly from Jiuyuan to Sweet Springs, cutting through mountains and filling in valleys for a distance of 1,800 li. The road had not yet been completed.

始皇三十七年冬，行出游会稽，并海上，北走琅邪。道病，使蒙毅还祷山川，未反。
秦始皇三十七年冬天，出行巡游会稽郡，沿着海边北上，前往琅邪。途中生病，派蒙毅返回（京城）祈祷山川神灵，蒙毅还没回来。
In the winter of the thirty-seventh year of Emperor Qin Shi Huang's reign, he went on a tour to Kuaiji; after that, he traveled along the coast and then went north to Langya. On the way, he fell ill and sent Meng Yi back to pray to the mountains and rivers, but Meng Yi had not yet returned.

始皇至沙丘崩，秘之，群臣莫知。
秦始皇抵达沙丘时去世，（消息）被封锁，大臣们都不知道。
when the emperor passed away at Shaqiu—this news was kept secret, and none of the court ministers knew about it.

是时丞相李斯、公子胡亥、中车府令赵高常从。高雅得幸于胡亥，欲立之，又怨蒙毅法治之而不为己也，因有贼心，乃与丞相李斯、公子胡亥阴谋，立胡亥为太子。
当时丞相李斯、公子胡亥、中车府令赵高一直随从。赵高向来得到胡亥的宠幸，想拥立胡亥（为帝），又怨恨蒙毅曾依法惩治自己却不偏袒自己，因而心生歹意，便与丞相李斯、公子胡亥暗中谋划，立胡亥为太子。
At that time, Prime Minister Li Si, Prince Hu Hai, and Zhao Gao, the director of the Palace Carriage Office, were always accompanying the emperor; Zhao Gao had long been favored by Hu Hai, wanted to help Hu Hai ascend the throne, and also resented Meng Yi (who had once punished him in accordance with the law and refused to show him favor), so he harbored malicious intentions and conspired in secret with Prime Minister Li Si and Prince Hu Hai to make Hu Hai the crown prince.

太子已立，遣使者以罪赐公子扶苏、蒙恬死。
太子（胡亥）确立后，派使者以罪名赐公子扶苏、蒙恬自杀。
After Hu Hai was established as the crown prince, envoys were sent to grant Prince Fu Su and Meng Tian death on charges of crimes.

扶苏已死，蒙恬疑而复请之。使者以蒙恬属吏，更置。胡亥以李斯舍人为护军。
扶苏死后，蒙恬（对这件事）心存疑虑，便请求（使者）重新核查。使者把蒙恬交给执法官吏（看管），更换了（他的职务）。胡亥派李斯的家臣担任护军（监督蒙恬的军队）。
after Fu Su died, Meng Tian harbored doubts and requested a re-investigation of the case, so the envoys handed Meng Tian over to the government officials and replaced him in his official post, while Hu Hai appointed a retainer of Li Si as the military supervisor.

使者还报，胡亥已闻扶苏死，即欲释蒙恬。赵高恐蒙氏复贵而用事，怨之。
使者回来复命，胡亥听说扶苏已死，就想释放蒙恬。赵高担心蒙氏家族再次显贵并掌权，（因而）对蒙氏心怀怨恨（，不愿释放）。
When the envoys returned to report, Hu Hai, having heard of Fu Su's death, intended to release Meng Tian immediately, but Zhao Gao feared that the Meng clan would regain their noble status and hold power again, so he still bore a grudge against them.

毅还至，赵高因为胡亥忠计，欲以灭蒙氏，乃言曰：“臣闻先帝欲举贤立太子久矣，而毅谏曰‘不可'。若知贤而俞弗立，则是不忠而惑主也。以臣愚意，不若诛之。”
蒙毅回来后，赵高借着为胡亥忠心谋划的名义，想消灭蒙氏家族，便进言说：“我听说先帝早就想选拔贤能之人立为太子，可蒙毅却劝谏说‘不行’。他明知您贤能，却越发阻挠立您为太子，这是对您不忠，还蒙蔽先帝。依我的浅见，不如杀了他。”
When Meng Yi returned to the capital from his mission, Zhao Gao, pretending to be acting solely out of loyalty to Huhai, set about to wipe out the Meng family. “I have heard that the former emperor had long wanted to promote a man of worth by setting you up as heir apparent,” Zhao Gao said to Huhai. “But Meng Yi remonstrated with him, insisted that it would not do. If Meng Yi knew you were a worthy man but persisted in opposing your appointment, then he acted disloyally and was deliberately misleading the ruler. In my humble opinion, he had best be punished for it!”

胡亥听而系蒙毅于代。前已囚蒙恬于阳周。
胡亥听从了（赵高的建议），把蒙毅囚禁在代地。在此之前，已经把蒙恬囚禁在阳周。
Huhai, heeding this advice, had Meng Yi seized and put in bonds in Dai. Earlier he had had Meng Tian imprisoned in Yangzhou.

丧至咸阳，已葬，太子立为二世皇帝，而赵高亲近，日夜毁恶蒙氏，求其罪过，举劾之。
（秦始皇的）灵柩运到咸阳，安葬完毕后，太子（胡亥）即位为二世皇帝。赵高得到（二世的）亲近，日夜诋毁蒙氏兄弟，搜罗他们的罪过，检举弹劾他们。
By this time the body of the First Emperor had arrived in Xianyang. After the interment, the heir apparent ascended the throne and is known as the Second Emperor. Zhao Gao was constantly by his side, day and night speaking ill of the Meng family, ferreting out their crimes and errors and promoting their impeachment.

子婴进谏曰：“臣闻故赵王迁杀其良臣李牧而用颜聚，燕王喜阴用荆轲之谋而倍秦之约，齐王建杀其故世忠臣而用后胜之议。此三君者，皆各以变古者失其国而殃及其身。
子婴进言劝谏道：“我听说从前赵王迁杀死他的良臣李牧，改用颜聚；燕王喜暗中采用荆轲的计谋，违背与秦国的盟约；齐王建诛杀历代效忠的大臣，采纳后胜的建议。这三位君主，都因为改变旧制而丧失国家，灾祸累及自身。
Ziying came forward to remonstrate with the Second Emperor, saying, “I have heard that in past times King Qian of Zhao put to death his loyal minister Li Mu and employed Yan Ju instead, that King Xi of Yan secretly heeded the advice of Jing Ke and broke his promise to the state of Qin, and that King Jian of Qi killed the ministers who had served him loyally for generations and adopted the advice of Hou Sheng. These three rulers, because they changed old ways, all lost their states and brought calamity upon themselves.

今蒙氏，秦之大臣谋士也，而主欲一旦弃去之，臣窃以为不可。
如今蒙氏是秦国的重臣和谋士，而陛下却想一下子抛弃他们，我私下认为（这样做）不可。
Now the members of the Meng family are high officials and ministers of planning in Qin. As ruler, you may wish to rid yourself of them all in one morning, but I venture to think such a course is not right.

臣闻轻虑者不可以治国，独智者不可以存君。诛杀忠臣而立无节行之人，是内使群臣不相信而外使斗士之意离也，臣窃以为不可。”
我听说考虑事情轻率的人不能治理国家，刚愎自用、自以为聪明的人不能保全君位。诛杀忠臣却任用没有节操的人，会使朝廷内的群臣失去信任，使在外的将士离心离德，我私下认为（这样做）不可。”
“I have heard that one who is reckless in planning can never govern a nation, and one who considers himself the sole possessor of wisdom can never preserve his ruler. If you put to death loyal ministers and in their place promote men who have done no exemplary deeds, then at home you will create distrust among your officials, and abroad will encourage disaffection in your fighting men. I venture to think that such a course is not right!”

二世又遣使者之阳周，令蒙恬曰：“君之过多矣，而卿弟毅有大罪，法及内史。”
秦二世又派使者前往阳周，对蒙恬下令说：“您的罪过够多了，而您的弟弟蒙毅犯有大罪，依法牵连到您。”
The Second Emperor also sent an envoy to Yangzhou with an order to Meng Tian that read: “Your errors are many, and your younger brother Yi has committed serious crimes. Under the law, you are implicated as well.”

恬曰：“自吾先人，及至子孙，积功信于秦三世矣。今臣将兵三十余万，身虽囚系，其势足以倍畔，然自知必死而守义者，不敢辱先人之教，以不忘先主也。
蒙恬说：“从我祖父到子孙，在秦国积累功劳和信义已有三代。如今我统领三十多万军队，虽被囚禁，势力仍足以反叛，但我明知必死却坚守道义，是因不敢辱没先人的教诲，不忘先帝的恩德。”
Meng Tian replied, “From my grandfather down to his sons and grandsons, my family has accumulated merit and enjoyed trust with Qin for three generations. I have been put in command of over 300,000 troops, and though I am bound and imprisoned, I have power enough to carry out a revolt. But, although I know it means death, I have abided by the principles of righteousness because I would not dare to disgrace the teachings of my forbears, and because I cannot forget my debt to the former emperor.

昔周成王初立，未离襁褓，周公旦负王以朝，卒定天下。及成王有病甚殆，公旦自撤其爪以沉于河，曰：‘王未有识，是旦执事。有罪殃，旦受其不祥。’乃书而藏之记府，可谓信矣。
从前周成王刚即位时，还在襁褓中，周公旦背着他上朝，最终平定天下。成王病重时，周公旦剪下自己的指甲沉入黄河，说：‘君王年幼无知，由我执政。若有罪过灾祸，我来承受。’并将此事记录下来藏入府库，可见其忠诚。
“In ancient times, when King Cheng of the Zhou dynasty was first made ruler, he was still a babe in swaddling clothes. His uncle, Dan, the Duke of Zhou, carried the infant king on his back when he attended court, and so peace was brought to the empire. Later, King Cheng fell gravely ill and his life was in danger. The Duke of Zhou pared his fingernails and threw the parings into the Yellow River, saying, ‘The king as yet has no understanding of state affairs; I alone am handling them. If there is some fault, I alone should suffer the ill effects.’ Then he made a record of what he had done and stored it away in the archives. He acted, one may say, in complete good faith.

及王能治国，有贼臣言：‘周公旦欲为乱久矣，王若不备，必有大事。’王乃大怒，周公旦走而奔于楚。成王观于记府，得周公旦沉书，乃流涕曰：‘孰谓周公旦欲为乱乎！’杀言之者而反周公旦。故《周书》曰‘必参而伍之’。
成王长大后能治理国家，有奸臣说：‘周公旦早想作乱，大王若不防备，定会出大事。’成王大怒，周公旦逃到楚国。后来成王在府库中看到周公旦的祷词记录，流泪说：‘谁说周公旦想作乱！’于是杀了进谗言的人，召回周公旦。因此《周书》说‘必须多方验证考察’。
“Later, when the king grew old enough to govern the nation, evil ministers asserted that the Duke of Zhou had long been plotting revolt. If the king did not take precautions, they warned, the results would surely be calamitous. The king was enraged at these words, and the Duke of Zhou fled from the kingdom and took refuge in Chu. But when King Cheng examined the archives, he found the document recording the words the Duke of Zhou spoke when he threw the parings into the river. Tears streaming from his eyes, he said, ‘Who tells me that the Duke of Zhou is plotting revolt!’ He put to death those who had spoken so and recalled the Duke of Zhou. Therefore the Book of Zhou says: ‘One must know the threes and fives.’

今恬之宗，世无二心，而事卒如此，是必孽臣逆乱，内陵之道也。
如今我家族世代忠心，事情却到这地步，定是奸臣叛乱、欺君罔上所致。
“My family has served without duplicity for generations. If affairs have come to this, it must be because nefarious ministers are plotting treason and attempting to usurp power from within.

夫成王失而复振则卒昌；桀杀关龙逢，纣杀王子比干而不悔，身死则国亡。臣故曰‘过可振而谏可觉’也。
成王犯错后改正，周朝最终昌盛；夏桀杀关龙逢、商纣杀王子比干却不知悔改，最终身死国亡。因此我说‘过错可改正，劝谏能让人醒悟’。
“King Cheng committed an error, but he remedied it and hence in the end was able to flourish. But Emperor Jie killed Guan Longfeng and Emperor Zhou killed Prince Bi Gan and neither ever repented; so they brought death on themselves and the downfall of their kingdom. Therefore I say, ‘Faults can be remedied, remonstrance can bring understanding.’

察于参伍，上圣之法也。凡臣之言，非以求免于咎也，将以谏而死，愿陛下为万民思从道也。”
多方考察是圣君的治国之道。我所说的话，并非求免罪，而是想以死进谏，希望陛下为万民着想，遵循正道。”
“To examine the threes and fives is the method employed by the sages of antiquity. I say all these things not because I hope to escape censure, but because I wish my death to be a remonstrance. I beg that Your Majesty will give thought for the 10,000 people and abide by the Way.”

使者曰：“臣受诏行法于将军，不敢以将军言闻于上也。”
使者说：“我受诏对将军执行法令，不敢将您的话上报皇上。”
But the envoy said, “I have received an imperial decree to carry out the law, General. I cannot presume to relay your words to the sovereign.”

蒙恬喟然太息曰：“我何罪于天，无过而死乎？”良久，徐曰：“恬罪固当死矣。起临洮属之辽东，城堑万余里，此其中不能无绝地脉，此乃恬之罪也。”乃吞药自杀。
蒙恬长叹道：“我对上天有何罪过，要无罪而死呢？”过了很久，缓缓说：“我的罪过确实该死。从临洮到辽东，修筑长城、挖掘壕沟万余里，其间难免切断地脉，这就是我的罪过。”于是吞药自杀。
Meng Tian gave a deep sigh and said, “What crime have I committed before Heaven that I should die an innocent death?” Then after a long while he said in a grave manner, “In fact I deserve to die for the crime I have committed. From Lintao east to Liaodong I built a wall extending for 10,000 li and more. In the course of it, I could not help but cut through the arteries of the earth. That must be my crime!” Then he swallowed the poison and died.

太史公曰：吾适北边,自直道归,行观蒙恬所为秦筑长城亭障,堑山堙谷,通直道，固轻百姓力矣。
太史公说：我到过北方的边防前线，经由直道返回，沿路看到蒙恬为秦国修筑的长城堡垒，他挖山填谷、开通直道，本来就是过分耗费百姓人力的事。
The Grand Historian remarks: I once traveled to the northern border and returned via the Direct Road. Along the way, I saw the Great Wall, watchtowers, and barriers that Meng Tian built for Qin—he cut through mountains, filled valleys, and constructed the Direct Road, clearly squandering the people's labor.

夫秦之初灭诸侯，天下之心未定，痍伤者未瘳,而恬为名将，不以此时强谏，振百姓之急，养老存孤,务修众庶之和,而阿意兴功,此其兄弟遇诛，不亦宜乎?
秦国刚消灭诸侯时，天下人心尚未安定，受战乱创伤的人还未痊愈。蒙恬身为名将，不在此时极力劝谏（秦始皇），解救百姓的危难，供养老人、抚育孤儿，致力于维护百姓的安定和睦，反而迎合秦始皇的心意大兴工程。这样一来，他们兄弟被诛杀，不也是应当的吗？
When Qin first conquered the feudal lords, the hearts of the people were unsettled, and those wounded by war had not yet recovered. As a famous general, Meng Tian did not seize this moment to strongly remonstrate, relieve the people's urgency, support the elderly, care for orphans, or strive to foster harmony among the masses. Instead, he catered to Qin Shihuang's will and launched grand projects. Is it not fitting that he and his brother were executed?

何乃罪地脉哉?
为什么竟要归罪于（修工程）切断地脉呢？
Why then did they blame it on disrupting the "earth's veins"?
