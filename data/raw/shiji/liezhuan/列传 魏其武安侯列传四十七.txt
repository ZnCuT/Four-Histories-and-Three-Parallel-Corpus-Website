魏其侯窦婴者，孝文后从兄子也。
魏其侯窦婴，是孝文帝窦皇后堂兄的儿子。
Dou Ying, the marquis of Weiqi, was the son of a cousin of Empress Dou.

父世观津人。
从他的父亲以上，世世代代都住在观津。
Until his father's time his family had lived in Guanjin.

喜宾客。
窦婴喜欢结交宾客。
He had many protegés.

孝文时，婴为吴相，病免。
孝文帝在位时，窦婴做过吴国丞相，后来因为有病免官。
In the reign of Emperor Wen, Dou Ying served as chief minister of Wu but had to give up this post because of illness.

孝景初即位，为詹事。
孝景帝刚即位时，窦婴又被任命为詹事。
When Emperor Jing came to the throne, he served as steward in the household of the empress.

梁孝王者，孝景弟也，其母窦太后爱之。
梁孝王是孝景皇帝的同胞兄弟，他的母亲窦太后非常偏爱他。
Prince Xiao of Liang was Emperor Jing's younger brother and the favourite of Empress Dowager Dou.

梁孝王朝，因昆弟燕饮。
有一次梁孝王进京朝贡时，和孝景帝一起以兄弟的身份举行家宴。
When he came to court the emperor entertained him as a brother.

是时上未立太子，酒酣，从容言曰：“千秋之后传梁王。”
这时皇上还没有立太子，当大家喝酒喝得非常畅快时，孝景帝顺口说道：“等我死了之后我把帝位传给梁王。”
Emperor Jing had not yet designated his heir and while drinking one day he remarked casually, "When I die I shall pass on the crown to the prince of Liang.”

太后驩。
窦太后听了心里非常高兴。
Empress Dowager Dou was delighted.

窦婴引卮酒进上，曰：“天下者，高祖天下，父子相传，此汉之约也，上何以得擅传梁王！”
窦婴立刻端起一杯酒上前拦阻景帝说：“汉朝的天下是高祖打下来的，我们汉朝的规矩是父子依次相传，您怎么能够随便改变章程传给梁王呢！”
but Dou Ying presented a cup of wine to the emperor, protesting, "The empire was won by Emperor Gaozu and the rule of the House of Han is that the throne must pass from father to son. How can you make the prince of Liang your heir, sir?”

太后由此憎窦婴。
窦太后一听很不高兴，从此心里嫉恨窦婴。
Empress Dowager Dou hated Dou Ying for this.

窦婴亦薄其官，因病免。
窦婴也正嫌自己的官小，赌气推说有病辞职不干了。
and since he did not think much of his post he retired on the pretext of illness.

太后除窦婴门籍，不得入朝请。
窦太后趁着机会吊销了窦婴出入宫廷的凭证，不让他再进宫朝见皇帝。
Then the empress dowager struck his name off the palace list so that he could no longer go to court.

孝景三年，吴楚反，上察宗室诸窦毋如窦婴贤，乃召婴。
孝景帝三年，吴、楚等国发动了叛乱，皇上观察当时刘氏本族和窦氏外戚中的子弟们没有一个能像窦婴那么能干的，于是就把窦婴找了来。
When the princes of Wu and Chu rebelled in the third year of Emperor Jing, the emperor sent for Dou Ying, having decided that he was abler than anyone else in the imperial house or the Dou family.

婴入见，固辞谢病不足任。
窦婴进了宫，推说有病，说自己实在没有能力担此重任。
Dou Ying came to the palace... but insisted that he was too ill to take up a command.

太后亦惭。
窦太后这时对自己过去的做法也感到很惭愧。
... to the embarrassment of the empress dowager.

于是上曰：“天下方有急，王孙宁可以让邪？”
皇上对窦婴说：“国家眼下正处在紧急关头，王孙你难道还能再推辞吗？”
"At a time of crisis how can you refuse?" demanded the emperor.

乃拜婴为大将军，赐金千斤。
于是就任命窦婴为大将军，赐给他黄铜千斤。
He made Dou Ying grand marshal and presented him with a thousand catties of gold.

婴乃言袁盎、栾布诸名将贤士在家者进之。
窦婴受命后，随即又向孝景皇帝推荐了袁盎、栾布等一些在家闲居的将领和贤士。
Then Dou Ying recommended Yuan Ang, Luan Bu and other good army officers or scholars who were living in retirement.

所赐金，陈之廊庑下，军吏过，辄令财取为用，金无人家者。
窦婴回来后把皇上赏给他的黄铜全数摆在了军部议事厅下的走廊里，让自己手下的军官们根据自己的需要随便拿着用，他自己一点也不往家里拿。
He stacked the gold in his corridor and gatehouse so that officers who needed it could help themselves. None of it went to his own family.

窦婴守荥阳，监齐赵兵。
后来窦婴东出驻守荥阳，监督策应前往齐国、赵国讨伐叛乱的汉朝军队。
Dou Ying defended Xingyang and kept a watch over the forces of Qi and Zhao.

七国兵已尽破，封婴为魏其侯。
七国叛乱平定后，窦婴被封为魏其侯。
After the suppression of the revolt he was enfeoffed as marquis of Weiqi.

诸游士宾客争归魏其侯。
当时有许多游说之士和宾客们都争先恐后地来投奔他。
Then wandering scholars and protegés flocked to him eagerly to offer their services.

孝景时每朝议大事，条侯、魏其侯，诸列侯莫敢与亢礼。
在当时朝廷里有什么聚会要商议国家大事的时候，周亚夫（条侯）和窦婴（魏其侯）的地位最高，其他列侯们谁也不能跟他们两个分庭抗礼。
During the reign of Emperor Jing, no other nobles dared claim equality with the marquis of Tiao and the marquis of Weiqi in any important deliberations at court.

孝景四年，立栗太子，使魏其侯为太子傅。
孝景帝四年，立栗姬生的儿子刘荣为太子，任命窦婴为太子的师傅。
In the fourth year of Emperor Jing, his son by Lady Li was made crown prince and Dou Ying was appointed as his tutor.

孝景七年，栗太子废，魏其数争不能得。
孝景帝七年，太子刘荣被废，窦婴为此多次力争均未能挽回。
In the seventh year the crown prince was deposed although Dou Ying interceded for him several times.

魏其谢病，屏居蓝田南山之下数月，诸宾客辩士说之，莫能来。
于是窦婴推说有病辞职不干了，他隐居在蓝田县的南山下一住就是几个月，他门下的那些宾朋说客们百般劝说，他就是不出来。
Pleading illness he retired for several months to Lantian in the south hills, nor could any of his orators or protéges prevail on him to return.

梁人高遂乃说魏其曰：“能富贵将军者，上也；能亲将军者，太后也。
这时一个名叫高遂的梁国人对窦婴说：“能够让您富贵的是皇上，和您关系最近的是太后。
Then Gao Sui of Liang reasoned with him saying," The emperor has conferred rank and wealth on you, the empress dowager has befriended you.

今将军傅太子，太子废而不能争；争不能得，又弗能死。
您给太子做师傅，太子被废时您不能劝阻；劝阻不成时您又不能自杀。
You were the crown prince's tutor, yet you failed to prevent his being deposed and failed to die for him.

自引谢病，拥赵女，屏闲处而不朝。
到头来您只是推说有病整天搂着美女，躲在家里不去上朝。
You simply retired here on the pretext of illness to fondle beauties from Zhao and voice opinions at variance with those of the court.

相提而论，是自明扬主上之过。
把您这干什么和不干什么一对比，不是分明显出您对皇上的不满吗?
This means you are casting aspersions on your sovereign.

有如两宫螫将军，则妻子毋类矣。”
有朝一日要是皇上和太后合起来整您，那时您恐怕就要被满门抄斩了。”
Should the emperor and empress dowager turn against you, your whole family must perish.”

魏其侯然之，乃遂起，朝请如故。
窦婴一听有理，于是立刻由山里出来又去照常上朝了。
Convinced by this argument Dou Ying went back and started attending court as before.

桃侯免相，窦太后数言魏其侯。
桃侯刘舍被免去丞相后，窦太后一连几次谈到让窦婴为丞相。
When the marquis of Tao was dismissed from his post as prime minister, Empress Dowager Dou several times recommended Dou Ying.

孝景帝曰：“太后岂以为臣有爱，不相魏其?
孝景帝说：“您难道以为我是有什么吝惜，才不让窦婴当丞相吗?
"Don't think, madam, that I begrudge him the post," said the emperor.

魏其者，沾沾自喜耳，多易。难以为相，持重。”
不是的，窦婴这个人，容易自满骄傲，举动轻率，很难让他做丞相，担当国家重任。”
"But Dou Ying has too good an opinion of himself and takes life too easily. He is not fit for a responsible post like that of prime minister."

遂不用，用建陵侯卫绾为丞相。
于是就没有任用窦婴，而任用了建陵侯卫绾。
He appointed Wei Wan the marquis of Jianling instead.

武安侯田蚡者，孝景后同母弟也，生长陵。
武安侯田蚡，是孝景王皇后同母异父的弟弟，出生在长陵。
Tian Fen, the marquis of Wuan and younger brother of Empress Wang, was born in Changling.

魏其已为大将军后，方盛，蚡为诸郎，未贵，往来侍酒魏其，跪起如子姓。
当窦婴已经做了大将军声势正在煊盛的时候，田蚡还只是个小郎官，还远没有发达起来，这时他经常到窦婴家中应酬讨好，见了窦婴作揖磕头，行为完全像个晚辈。
When Dou Ying was grand marshal and at the height of his power, Tian Fen was still a palace guard, not yet ennobled. He used to go to Dou Ying's house and wait on him as a cup-bearer as humbly as his son.

及孝景晚节，蚡益贵幸，为太中大夫。
等到孝景帝晚年，田蚡就越来越受到宠爱了，被任为太中大夫。
Towards the end of Emperor Jing's reign, however, Tian Fen had risen to become grand counsellor.

蚡辩有口，学槃盂诸书，王太后贤之。
田蚡能言善辩，还学过一些古代陶器上的铭文，他的姐姐王太后很赏识他。
Tian Fen was eloquent, he had studied the ancient precepts inscribed on bronze vessels, and his sister, Empress Wang thought highly of him.

孝景崩，即日太子立，称制，所镇抚多有田蚡宾客计策。
孝景帝死后，太子刘彻当天就继位做了皇帝，由于武帝当时年龄小，王太后代行皇帝职权，在这新旧交替的关键时刻，在维持政局防止动乱方面，田蚡和他的门客们出了不少主意。
The day that Emperor Jing died, the crown prince ascended the throne with the empress dowager as regent,and many of the security measures she took were proposed by Tian Fen's followers.

蚡弟田胜，皆以太后弟，孝景后三年封蚡为武安侯，胜为周阳侯。
田蚡和他的弟弟田胜，都因为是王太后的弟弟，在孝景帝后元三年，田蚡被封为武安侯，田胜被封为周阳侯。
Because they were the empress dowager's brothers, Tian Fen and his younger brother Tian Sheng were enfeoffed in the last year of Emperor Jing's reign as the marquises of Wuan and Zhouyang.

武安侯新欲用事为相,卑下宾客，进名士家居者贵之，欲以倾魏其诸将相。
田蚡获得任命，一心想当丞相，为了实现这一目标，他就故意装出一副谦恭下士的样子，给皇帝推荐了一些闲在家里没有事的知名人士让他们出来作官，目的就是想以此来排挤窦婴等在位的元老将相。
Since Tian Fen wanted to take power and become prime minister he was good to his guests and honoured noted scholars living in retirement, hoping in this way to undermine Dou Ying and his powerful party.

建元元年,丞相绾病免,上议置丞相、太尉。
汉武帝建元元年，丞相卫绾因病免职，皇上正在考虑丞相、太尉的人选。
In the first year of the Jianyuan period, the prime minister Wei Wan was relieved of his duties because of ill health and Emperor Wu consulted his ministers about the appointment of a new prime minister and grand marshal.

籍福说武安侯曰:“魏其贵久矣，天下士素归之。今将军初兴,未如魏其，即上以将军为丞相，必让魏其。魏其为丞相，将军必为太尉。太尉、丞相尊等耳,又有让贤名。”
这时籍福就赶紧给田蚡建议说：“窦婴掌权很久了，天下的人士一向归附他。您刚刚兴起，声望还不如他，在这种情况下，假如皇上想让您当丞相，您一定要让给窦婴。窦婴要是当了丞相，您一定能当太尉。太尉和丞相的等级是一样的，这样您就白白地落一个让贤的名声。”
Ji Fu advised Tian Fen, saying, "Dou Ying has been prominent for a long time and worthy men from all over the land have flocked to him. Since you have just come to power and are not as influential as Dou Ying, if the emperor offers to make you prime minister you should decline in favour of Dou Ying. If he becomes prime minister you are sure to be made grand marshal. These two posts rank equal. And you will win praise for your modesty and wisdom.”

武安侯乃微言太后风上，于是乃以魏其侯为丞相，武安侯为太尉。
田蚡一听有理，立即就把籍福的这个意思悄悄地告诉了王太后，让王太后去给皇上吹风，汉武帝立即决定任命窦婴为丞相，任命田蚡做了太尉。
Tian Fen proposed this to the empress dowager, asking her to suggest it to the emperor. Then Dou Ying was made prime minister and Tian Fen grand marshal.

籍福贺魏其侯，因吊曰:“君侯资性喜善疾恶，方今善人誉君侯，故至丞相；然君侯且疾恶，恶人众，亦且毁君侯。君侯能兼容,则幸久；不能，今以毁去矣。”
这时籍福又来到窦婴家，他先是向窦婴表示了祝贺，紧接着就又向窦婴表示担心说：“您天生的性情是爱好人，恨坏人，现在正是因为有好人称赞您，所以您当了丞相；但是您又特别讨厌坏人，而坏人的数目更多，他们也必然要千方百计地毁谤您。因此如果您对好人、坏人都能兼容并包，那么您的丞相就可以长期地做下去；否则，您很快就会因为坏人的诽谤而被免职了。”
When Ji Fu congratulated Dou Ying he warned him, "I know, sir that you naturally appreciate good men and hate evil men. Now thanks to the praise of good men you have become prime minister. But because you hate evil men and they are many, they are bound to attack you. The more tolerance you can show, the longer you will enjoy your present position. Otherwise their slander will lead to your dismissal."

魏其不听。
窦婴不听。
But Dou Ying ignored his advice.

魏其、武安俱好儒术，推毂赵绾为御史大夫,王臧为郎中令。
窦婴和田蚡都喜好儒家的学说，他们推荐了赵绾为御史大夫，推荐了王臧为郎中令。
Both Dou Ying and Tian Fen admired the teachings of Confucius. Hence they recommended Zhao Wan for the post of chief counsellor and Wang Zang for that of chief of the palace guard.

迎鲁申公,欲设明堂,令列侯就国,除关,以礼为服制,以兴太平。
还把鲁国的儒生申培接到长安，想建立明堂，让住在长安的列侯们都到他们各自的封地去，想拆除各诸侯国与朝廷领地之间的关禁，要按照礼仪来制订不同等级的服饰制度，想以此来表明现在已经是一个百废俱兴的太平盛世。
They invited Master Shen of Lu to the capital and wanted to set up an Audience Hall, send the marquises back to their fiefs, abolish travel restrictions, change the funeral customs to accord with the ancient practice, and bring about a reign of peace.

举適诸窦宗室毋节行者,除其属籍。
他们还让人检举窦氏外戚和刘氏宗族中的品质恶劣的人，一经查出就从族谱上除掉他们的名字。
They denounced the members of the imperial clan and kinsmen of Empress Dowager Dou who were guilty of immoral conduct and had their names struck off the list of nobles.

时诸外家为列侯，列侯多尚公主，皆不欲就国，以故毁日至窦太后。
当时许多外戚都是列侯，而列侯们又多数是娶公主为妻，因此他们都不愿离开长安到自己的封地去，也正因此那些毁谤窦婴等人的话就整天不停地往窦太后的耳朵里灌了。
At that time most of the men of the Dou family had become marquises and married imperial princesses, and none of them wanted to return to their territories. So every day they slandered these two ministers to Empress Dowager Dou.

太后好黄老之言,而魏其、武安、赵绾、王臧等务隆推儒术，贬道家言，是以窦太后滋不说魏其等。
窦太后喜好黄帝、老子的学说，窦婴、田蚡、赵绾、王臧等专门推行儒家的一套，贬斥道家学派，因此窦太后心里很不喜欢窦婴等人。
And because she liked the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Lao Zi, while Dou Ying, Tian Fen, Zhao Wan and Wang Zang wanted to propagate Confucianism and suppress Taoism, her dislike for these men increased.

及建元二年,御史大夫赵绾请无奏事东宫。
等到汉武帝建元二年，御史大夫赵绾又建议皇上今后有事不要再去向窦太后请示。
In the second year of the Jianyuan period, the grand secretary Zhao Wan proposed that memoranda and reports should not be submitted to Empress Dowager Dou.

窦太后大怒，乃罢逐赵绾、王臧等，而免丞相、太尉,以柏至侯许昌为丞相,武强侯庄青翟为御史大夫。
窦太后大怒，立刻下令罢免和驱逐了赵绾、王臧等人，同时免去了窦婴和田蚡的职务，另任命柏至侯许昌为丞相，任命武强侯庄青翟为御史大夫。
In a great rage she dismissed him and three others and appointed Xu Chang the marquis of Bozhi as prime minister and Zhuang Qingdi the marquis of Wuqiang as grand secretary.

魏其、武安由此以侯家居。
从此窦婴和田蚡就只能以侯爵的身份在家里闲着了。
Dou Ying and Tian Fen retired from the government but retained their titles.

武安侯虽不任职，以王太后故，亲幸，数言事多效,天下吏士趋势利者，皆去魏其归武安。
田蚡虽然不担任职务，但由于他是王太后的弟弟，所以仍然受到皇帝的信任，他多次向皇上提出的建议都被采纳了，于是那些势利眼的官吏和士大夫们，就都纷纷地离开窦婴去巴结田蚡。
Although Tian Fen was now out of office, he was still a favourite because of Empress Dowager Wang, and his advice was often taken. And so all those officers and gentlemen who were eager for power or profit left Dou Ying and flocked to Tian Fen.

武安日益横。
田蚡一天比一天更骄横。
who grew daily more high-handed.

建元六年,窦太后崩，丞相昌、御史大夫青翟坐丧事不办，免。
汉武帝建元六年，窦太后死了，丞相许昌、御史大夫庄青翟因为丧事办得不好，都被免职。
In the sixth year of Jianyuan, Empress Dowager Dou died. The prime minister Xu Chang and the grand secretary Zhuang Qingdi were accused of mismanaging the funeral and dismissed.

以武安侯蚡为丞相,以大司农韩安国为御史大夫。
武帝任命田蚡为丞相，任命大司农韩安国为御史大夫。
Tian Fen was made prime minister with Han Anguo, the minister of revenue, as grand secretary.

天下士郡诸侯愈益附武安。
这一来，所有的士大夫以及各郡县各诸侯国的人们就更加趋附田蚡了。
Thereupon the gentlemen of the empire and the marquises of the principalities rallied even more closely round him.

武安者，貌侵，生贵甚。
武安侯（田蚡）相貌丑陋矮小，生性却极为骄贵。
Tian Fen was undistinguished in appearance but he attained great distinction.

又以为诸侯王多长,上初即位，富于春秋,蚡以肺腑为京师相,非痛折节以礼诎之，天下不肃。
他又认为诸侯王大多年纪大，皇上刚即位，年纪尚轻，自己凭借皇亲国戚的身份担任朝廷丞相，若不用礼法严厉折服他们，天下人不会敬畏。
At that time most of the princes were old while Emperor Wu was young when he ascended the throne. Tian Fen felt that as prime minister and a relative of the imperial house, he must force others to submit humbly to him or he would not be respected through the land.

当是时，丞相入奏事，坐语移日,所言皆听。
当时，丞相（田蚡）进宫奏事，坐着谈论一整天，他说的话皇上都听从。
When he went to the palace to make his reports as prime minister, he would sit talking for hours, and all his proposals were accepted.

荐人或起家至二千石，权移主上。
他推荐的人，有的从平民直接提拔到二千石的职位，权力超过了皇上。
When recommending men for office, he sometimes had commoners appointed as officials of the two thousand piculs rank. He became the dominant force behind the throne.

上乃曰：“君除吏已尽未?吾亦欲除吏。”
皇上于是说：“您任命官吏完了没有？我也想任命几个官吏。”
Once the emperor asked, "Have you finished appointing officials? If you have, I should like to select some myself.”

尝请考工地益宅,上怒曰：“君何不遂取武库!”是后乃退。
（田蚡）曾请求把考工室的土地划给他扩建住宅，皇上生气地说：“您怎么不干脆把武库也拿去！”从那以后他才收敛一些。
Another time Tian Fen asked for some land belonging to a government workshop to enlarge his estate, and the emperor retorted angrily, "Why don’t you simply take over the armoury?" After that he was a little more circumspect.

尝召客饮，坐其兄盖侯南乡，自坐东乡，以为汉相尊，不可以兄故私桡。
（田蚡）曾召集宾客饮酒，让他的哥哥盖侯面朝南站坐，自己面朝东站坐，认为汉朝丞相地位尊贵，不能因为哥哥的缘故私下降低身份。
One day Tian Fen invited guests to a drinking party and made his elder brother, the marquis of Gai, sit facing south while he took the place of honour facing east. He explained that family etiquette must not be allowed to detract from the prime minister's dignity.

武安由此滋骄，治宅甲诸第。
武安侯从此更加骄纵，修建的住宅在众多贵族宅第中排名第一。
As time went on he became more and more overbearing. His mansions were the finest in the land.

田园极膏腴，而市买郡县器物相属于道。
他的田地庄园都极其肥沃，从各郡县采买器物的人在道路上接连不断。
He owned the most fertile fields, and the roads were thronged with merchants bringing him goods from all parts of the empire.

前堂罗钟鼓，立曲旃;后房妇女以百数。
前厅陈列着钟鼓，树立着曲柄长旗；后房的姬妾数以百计。
In the front hall he had a display of bronze bells, drums and pennants on curved flagstaffs, while in the inner quarters were hundreds of women.

诸侯奉金玉狗马玩好，不可胜数。
各诸侯进献的金银珠宝、狗马玩物，多得数不清。
As for the dogs, horses, jewels and other articles of amusement and adornment presented to him by various nobles, these were past counting.

魏其失窦太后，益疏不用，无势，诸客稍稍自引而怠傲,唯灌将军独不失故。
魏其侯（窦婴）失去窦太后的庇护后，越发被疏远不被重用，没有权势，众门客渐渐自动离去，对他懈怠傲慢，只有灌将军（灌夫）始终保持旧日态度。
Dou Ying had lost power since the death of Empress Dowager Dou and one by one all his protégés left him in contempt except General Guan Fu.

魏其日默默不得志，而独厚遇灌将军。
魏其侯终日闷闷不乐，志向难以实现，却特别优厚地对待灌将军。
Thus Dou Ying, in his bitterness and frustration, treated General Guan Fu as his only friend.

灌将军夫者，颍阴人也。
灌将军灌夫，是颍阴人。
General Guan Fu was a man of Yingyin.

夫父张孟，尝为颍阴侯婴舍人,得幸，因进之至二千石，故蒙灌氏姓为灌孟。
灌夫的父亲张孟，曾做过颍阴侯灌婴的门客，受到宠信，因此被提拔到二千石的职位，所以冒用灌氏的姓，改名为灌孟。
His father Zhang Meng had been a favourite steward of Guan Ying, the marquis of Yingyin, who raised him to be an official of the two thousand piculs rank. Out of gratitude he took Guan's name, becoming Guan Meng.

吴楚反时，颍阴侯灌何为将军,属太尉,请灌孟为校尉。
吴、楚七国叛乱时，颍阴侯灌何担任将军，隶属于太尉（周亚夫），他请求任命灌孟为校尉。
During the rebellion of Wu and Chu, Guan He, the second marquis of Yingyin, served as a general under the grand marshal and Guan Meng was made a general.

夫以千人与父俱。
灌夫率领一千人与父亲一同出征。
Guan Fu accompanied his father to the war at the head of a thousand men.

灌孟年老，颍阴侯强请之，郁郁不得意,故战常陷坚,遂死吴军中。
灌孟年纪大了，颍阴侯强行推荐他，他心中郁郁不得志，所以作战时常常冲向敌人坚固的阵地，最终死在吴军之中。
By this time Guan Meng was an old man, but the marquis of Yingyin insisted that he should accept the command; so in his resentment he kept charging the enemy's strong points until he was cut down by the troops of Wu.

军法，父子俱从军，有死事，得与丧归。
依照军法，父子一同参军，若有一人战死，另一人可以护送灵柩回家。
According to the military regulations, when both father and son serve in the army and one is killed, the other may ask leave to attend to the funeral.

灌夫不肯随丧归，奋曰：“愿取吴王若将军头,以报父之仇。”
灌夫不肯护送灵柩回去，激昂地说：“我希望砍下吴王或他麾下将军的头，来为父亲报仇。”
But instead of doing this, Guan Fu hotly vowed, "I shall avenge my father by cutting off the head of the prince of Wu or one of his generals.”

于是灌夫被甲持戟，募军中壮士所善愿从者数十人。
于是灌夫身披铠甲，手持长戟，招募军中与他交好、愿意跟随他的壮士几十人。
He buckled on his armour, seized his halberd, and called for a few dozen volunteers to go with him.

及出壁门，莫敢前。
等到走出营门，（众人）都不敢前进。
Once outside their ramparts, however, the others dared not charge the enemy.

独二人及从奴十数骑驰入吴军，至吴将麾下，所杀伤数十人。
只有两人和十几个家奴骑马冲入吴军，一直冲到吴将的指挥旗下，杀死杀伤几十人。
Only two men and about a dozen attendants galloped with him through the ranks of Wu. They fought their way up to one of the enemy flags and killed or wounded several dozen men.

不得前，复驰还，走入汉壁，皆亡其奴，独与一骑归。
无法继续前进，又骑马返回，冲进汉军营垒，家奴们都战死了，只和一人骑马回来。
but could advance no further. By the time Guan Fu galloped back to the Han ramparts, all his attendants were dead and only one man returned with him.

夫身中大创十余，适有万金良药，故得无死。
灌夫身上受了十几处重伤，恰巧有价值万金的良药，所以得以不死。
Guan Fu himself had received more than ten serious wounds, but his life was saved with a precious salve.

夫创少瘳，又复请将军曰：“吾益知吴壁中曲折，请复往。”
灌夫伤势稍有好转，又向灌何请求说：“我更了解吴军营垒中的布局了，请允许我再次前往。”
When he had somewhat recovered, he asked permission to try again now that he had a better idea of Wu's defences.

将军壮义之,恐亡夫，乃言太尉，太尉乃固止之。
灌何赞赏他的英勇和义气，担心他战死，就把这事报告给太尉，太尉于是坚决阻止了他。
His general admired his spirit but did not want to lose him, so he reported the matter to the grand marshal who forbade Guan Fu to make the attempt.

吴已破，灌夫以此名闻天下。
吴军被打败后，灌夫因此闻名天下。
After the prince of Wu's defeat, Guan Fu's fame spread throughout the land.

颍阴侯言之上，上以夫为中郎将。
灌何（颍阴侯）回朝后向景帝汇报了灌夫的表现，景帝任命灌夫为中郎将。
The marquis of Yingyin reported this to the emperor, who made Guan Fu general of the palace guard.

数月，坐法去。
结果只干了几个月，就因为犯法被免职了。
A few months later, however, he was dismissed for some offence.

后家居长安，长安中诸公莫弗称之。
后来他搬家到长安居住，长安城里的有声望之人没有不称赞他的。
He made his home in the capital and everyone in Chang'an spoke highly of him.

孝景时，至代相。
孝景帝时期，灌夫官至代国丞相。
During the reign of Emperor Jing he was appointed as chief minister of the principality of Dai.

孝景崩，今上初即位，以为淮阳天下交，劲兵处，故徙夫为淮阳太守。
孝景帝去世，当今皇上（武帝）刚即位，认为淮阳是天下的交通枢纽、军事要地，所以调灌夫任淮阳太守。
After Emperor Jing died and the present emperor had just come to the throne, Guan Fu was appointed as governor of Huaiyang because that was a centre of communications and a military stronghold.

建元元年，入为太仆。
武帝建元元年，灌夫被调进京城任太仆。
In the first year of Jianyuan, he served as minister of the imperial equipage.

二年，夫与长乐卫尉窦甫饮，轻重不得，夫醉，搏甫。
建元二年，灌夫和长乐卫尉窦甫一起饮酒，因饮酒时礼数或言语不当起了争执，灌夫喝醉后殴打了窦甫。
The next year while drinking one day with Dou Fu, commander of the Changle Palace guard, Guan Fu quarrelled with him and, being in his cups, struck him.

甫，窦太后昆弟也。
窦甫，是窦太后的兄弟。
Dou Fu was the younger brother of Empress Dowager Dou.

上恐太后诛夫，徙为燕相。
武帝怕窦太后杀灌夫，就调灌夫任燕国丞相。
Afraid the empress dowager might have Guan Fu killed, the emperor transferred him to be the chief minister of the principality of Yan.

数岁，坐法去官，家居长安。
几年后，灌夫又因犯法丢官，在长安家中闲居。
Several years later he was dismissed for some offence and returned to the capital to live in retirement.

灌夫为人刚直使酒，不好面谀。
灌夫为人刚强正直，常因饮酒发脾气，不喜欢当面讨好别人。
Guan Fu was strong-willed, outspoken and boisterous when drunk. He never flattered anybody.

贵戚诸有势在己之右，不欲加礼，必陵之；
对那些地位、权势比自己高的皇亲贵戚，他不愿以礼相待，反而必定要欺辱他们；
He behaved in a cavalier and insulting way to nobles and all who were more powerful than himself.

诸士在己之左，愈贫贱，尤益敬，与钧。
对那些地位比自己低的士人，越是贫贱的，他就越是敬重，与他们平等相待。
but treated those below him as his equals—the poorer they were, the more respect he showed.

稠人广众，荐宠下辈。
在大庭广众之中，他特别喜欢推荐、表扬地位比自己低的人。
In a large group he always singled out his inferiors for attention.

士亦以此多之。
士人也因此称赞他。
and gentlemen admired him for this trait.

夫不喜文学，好任侠，已然诺。
灌夫不喜欢儒家学说，喜好行侠仗义，凡是答应别人的事必定兑现。
He had no taste for literature but admired gallant deeds of daring and kept his word without fail.

诸所与交通，无非豪杰大猾。
他所结交的人，无一不是豪杰或有势力的精明人。
All his friends were prominent citizens or men of great resourcefulness.

家累数千万，食客日数十百人。
家中积累的财产有几千万，每天来投奔的食客有几十上百人。
His property ran into tens of millions of cash, and he daily entertained tens and hundreds of guests.

陂池田园，宗族宾客为权利，横于颍川。
（灌夫家有）池塘、田地，他的宗族和宾客借着他的权势谋求私利，在颍川郡横行霸道。
His estates were large, including hills, lakes and fields, and he had a host of kinsmen and protegés. His power went unchallenged in Yingchuan.

颍川儿乃歌之曰：“颍水清，灌氏宁；颍水浊，灌氏族。”
颍川的儿童于是唱道：“颍水清清，灌氏安宁；颍水浑浊，灌氏灭族。”
where the children used to sing: "When the River Ying runs clear, The Guans have nothing to fear; When the River Ying runs muddy, The Guans' end will be bloody!"

灌夫家居虽富，然失势，卿相侍中宾客益衰。
灌夫虽在家闲居且富有，但因失势，过去来往的卿相、侍中之类的宾客越来越少了。
But although Guan Fu was wealthy, his power declined once he was out of office and the ministers, courtiers and protégés who had associated with him stayed away.

及魏其侯失势，亦欲倚灌夫引绳批根生平慕之后弃之者。
等到魏其侯窦婴失势，（窦婴）也想依靠灌夫去整治那些原先仰慕自己、后来又抛弃自己的人。
So when Dou Ying also lost power, he was eager to join forces with Guan Fu and sever relations with those former admirers who had now deserted him.

灌夫亦倚魏其而通列侯宗室为名高。
灌夫也想依靠魏其侯（的关系）结交列侯、宗室，来提高自己的声望。
Guan Fu for his part hoped with the help of Dou Ying to make friends with other nobles and imperial clansmen and so increase his reputation.

两人相为引重，其游如父子然。
两人互相扶持、推崇，相处得像父子一样。
The mutual attraction and admiration they felt made the two men as close as father and son.

相得欢甚，无厌，恨相知晚也。
（他们）相处得非常融洽，没有厌倦，只恨相识得太晚。
They got on capitally together, never tiring of each other's company; they only regretted that they had not met earlier.

灌夫有服，过丞相。丞相从容曰：“吾欲与仲孺过魏其侯，会仲孺有服。”
有一次，灌夫还在为他姐姐服丧，偶然到田蚡家里去了。田蚡顺口说：“本来想和你一起去看看魏其侯，不巧正赶上你有丧服在身。”
One day when Guan Fu was in mourning he called on Tian Fen the prime minister, who remarked casually," I would like to go with you to see Dou Ying the marquis of Weiqi. It is a pity that you are in mourning."

灌夫曰：“将军乃肯幸临况魏其侯，夫安敢以服为解！请语魏其侯帐具，将军旦日蚤临。”武安许诺。
灌夫说：“只要您肯赏光去魏其侯家，我怎么会以丧服在身推辞呢！请让我先去告诉魏其侯家准备酒席，请您明天一早大驾光临。”田蚡答应了。
"If Your Excellency means to do him that honour, I certainly can- not let my mourning stand in the way," said Guan Fu." May I tell him to prepare for a visit from you early tomorrow?" Tian Fen agreed.

灌夫具语魏其侯如所谓武安侯。魏其与其夫人益市牛酒，夜洒扫，帐具至旦。
灌夫赶紧来到窦婴家把他同田蚡说的话向窦婴说了一遍，窦婴一听就赶紧同他的夫人准备了许多酒肉，连夜打扫厅堂，摆设筵席一直忙到天亮。
Guan Fu told Dou Ying what he had said to Tian Fen. Then Dou Ying and his wife bought plenty of beef and wine and spent the whole night cleaning and sweeping their house to have all ready for the feast.

平明，令门下候伺。至日中，丞相不来。魏其谓灌夫曰：“丞相岂忘之哉？”
从天亮开始窦婴就派了人到门前去张望着，一直等到中午，田蚡还没来。于是窦婴就对灌夫说：“丞相莫非是忘了吗？”
Early the next morning they posted attendants outside the gate to keep a look-out for the prime minister, but though they waited till noon he did not come. Dou Ying asked Guan Fu, "Could the prime minister have forgotten?”

灌夫不怿，曰：“夫以服请，宜往。”乃驾，自往迎丞相。
灌夫也不高兴地说：“我昨天是不顾丧服在身邀请了他，他不应该不来，我可以去看看。”于是就赶着车子亲自去迎接田蚡。
"I invited him in spite of my mourning," replied Guan Fu sullenly. "He ought to have come." And he took a carriage to fetch Tian Fen.

丞相特前戏许灌夫，殊无意往。及夫至门，丞相尚卧。
而田蚡昨天其实只不过是开玩笑随便说说，内心里就根本没有打算去。等到灌夫到了他家，田蚡还没有起床。
Tian Fen had been joking the previous day as it happened, and had no intention of going. When Guan Fu reached his gate he was still in bed.

于是夫入见，曰：“将军昨日幸许过魏其，魏其夫妻治具，自旦至今，未敢尝食。”
灌夫进来问田蚡说：“昨天承蒙您答应去拜访魏其侯，魏其侯夫妇为您准备筵席，从一大早到现在，因为您没有去，人家还一直不敢动筷子。”
Guan Fu strode in and said, "Yesterday Your Excellency promised to call on the marquis of Weiqi. He and his wife have prepared a feast and been waiting since early morning, not venturing to take a bite.”

武安鄂谢曰：“吾昨日醉，忽忘与仲孺言。”乃驾往，又徐行，灌夫愈益怒。
田蚡一听吃了一惊赶紧道歉说：“我昨天喝醉了，忘了同你说过的话。”说罢前往，在路上又走得很慢，于是灌夫心里就觉得很恼火。
Tian Fen was taken aback and apologized, saying," I must have had too much to drink yesterday. It completely slipped my mind." He set off in his carriage but drove so slowly that Guan Fu grew even angrier than before.

及饮酒酣，夫起舞属丞相，丞相不起，夫从坐上语侵之。
等到在窦婴家大家喝酒喝得高兴时，灌夫站起来跳舞，然后又邀请田蚡接着跳。不想田蚡竟坐着不动，灌夫忍不住就在自己的坐位上骂了起来。
At the height of the feast Guan Fu rose to dance, after which he urged Tian Fen to perform a dance, but the latter refused to move. Then Guan Fu sat there making cutting remarks.

魏其乃扶灌夫去，谢丞相。丞相卒饮至夜，极驩而去。
窦婴一看赶紧起来打圆场，扶着灌夫离开了席面，他自己过去向田蚡解释道歉。田蚡也就放开了，于是他们一直喝到夜晚，田蚡尽兴而去。
till Dou Ying dragged him out and apologized for him to the prime minister. Tian Fen stayed and drank till nightfall, when he went cheerfully away.

丞相尝使籍福请魏其城南田。魏其大望曰：“老仆虽弃，将军虽贵，宁可以势夺乎！”不许。
田蚡有一次让籍福去向窦婴要他家城南的一块地。窦婴不高兴地说：“我虽然被朝廷抛弃了，田将军虽然正在贵宠，难道他就可以倚仗权势来夺我的地吗！”坚决不答应。
Later on, Tian Fen sent Ji Fu to ask Dou Ying for some fields south of the city which he owned. Dou Ying refused, indignantly exclaiming," I may be an old man who has been pushed aside while he holds the high rank of prime minister, but he has no right to seize my land.”

灌夫闻，怒，骂籍福。
灌夫听说这事后，非常生气，他当面大骂籍福。
When Guan Fu heard this he cursed Ji Fu roundly.

籍福恶两人有郄，乃谩自好谢丞相曰：“魏其老且死，易忍，且待之。”
籍福害怕两家的矛盾由此加深，于是就自己另编了一套话，对田蚡说：“魏其侯老得活不多久了，您稍微忍耐几天，等他死了再说。”
Anxious to avoid a quarrel between Tian Fen and Dou Ying, Ji Fu made some excuses to the prime minister to smooth the matter over." Dou Ying is old and won't live much longer," he said. "Just be patient and wait.”

已而武安闻魏其、灌夫实怒不予田，亦怒曰：“魏其子尝杀人，蚡活之。蚡事魏其无所不可，何爱数顷田？且灌夫何与也？吾不敢复求田。”
过后不久田蚡知道了原来是窦婴和灌夫生气不给他，于是也生气地说：“魏其侯的儿子曾经杀人犯了死罪，是我救了他的命。我对待魏其侯没有一样不满足他的要求，怎么他今天就连几顷地也舍不得？而且这件事又与灌夫有什么关系？算了，我再也不和他要这块地了。”
But when Tian Fen learned that Dou Ying and Guan Fu had an- grily refused to give up the fields, he flew into a passion." I saved Dou Ying's son after he killed a man,"he fumed." I have treated him handsomely in every respect. Why should he grudge me a few plots of land? In any case, what has this to do with Guan Fu? Well, I shall not ask again."

武安由此大怨灌夫、魏其。
田蚡从此就特别痛恨灌夫和窦婴。
From that day on,Tian Fen bore a deep grudge against Guan Fu and Dou Ying.

元光四年春,丞相言灌夫家在颍川，横甚，民苦之。请案。
元光四年春天，田蚡向武帝揭发灌夫家族在颍川骄横霸道，百姓们大吃苦头，请求依法查办。
In the spring of the fourth year of Yuanguang, Tian Fen reported to the emperor, “Guan Fu's family in Yingchuan is so overbearing that the people are suffering. I ask for an investigation."

上曰：“此丞相事，何请。”
武帝说：“这是你职务以内的事情，不必向我请示。”
"This is within your jurisdiction as prime minister," replied the emperor. “Why ask my permission?”

灌夫亦持丞相阴事，为奸利,受淮南王金与语言。
但由于灌夫也抓着田蚡的一些把柄，诸如为非作歹图谋私利，接受淮南王的贿赂，以及说了许多不该说的话等等。
Guan Fu for his part knew something of Tian Fen's dark deeds and corruption, and was aware that he was in communication with the prince of Huainan and had accepted bribes from him.

宾客居间，遂止，俱解。
由于两家的宾客们从中调解，于是彼此又都停了下来，暂时和解了。
But friends intervened to patch things up between them.

夏，丞相取燕王女为夫人,有太后诏，召列侯宗室皆往贺。
同年夏天，田蚡娶燕王刘嘉的女儿做夫人，太后下令，叫列侯宗室们都要前去祝贺。
That summer Tian Fen married the daughter of the prince of Yan, and the empress dowager decreed that all the nobles and members of the imperial house should go to offer their congratulations.

魏其侯过灌夫，欲与俱。
这时窦婴去找灌夫，要和他一道去。
Dou Ying called to ask Guan Fu to accompany him.

夫谢曰：“夫数以酒失得过丞相，丞相今者又与夫有郄。”
灌夫推辞说：“我曾多次因酒后失言得罪过他，我看他近来似乎对我特别仇恨。”
but Guan Fu declined. "I have offended the prime minister several times when in my cups," he said. “And now he has another grudge against me.”

魏其曰：“事已解。”强与俱。
窦婴说：“过去的事情不是都已经解开了吗。”于是硬拉着灌夫一同去了。
"But all that has been settled," said Dou Ying, and prevailed upon Guan Fu to go with him.

饮酒酣，武安起为寿，坐皆避席伏。
到了宴会上人们酒兴正浓的时候，田蚡站起来给大家敬酒，于是在座的人都赶快离开席位俯伏在地，表示不敢当。
When the drinking was at its height Tian Fen rose to propose a toast, at which all his guests left their mats and bowed low.

已魏其侯为寿，独故人避席耳，余半膝席。
过了一会儿窦婴也起来给大家敬酒，这回只有他的老朋友们离开席位，其余半数的人都只是在席上跪起身子而没有离席。
But when Dou Ying proposed a toast only his friends left their mats, all the other guests simply kneeling where they were.

灌夫不悦。
灌夫看着心里生气。
Guan Fu took umbrage at this.

起行酒，至武安，武安膝席曰：“不能满觞。”
于是就自己起来给大家敬酒，当他走到田蚡跟前时，田蚡跪起身子推辞说：“不能再太满了。”
and rose to urge the rest to drink. When he came to Tian Fen, the prime minister merely knelt on his mat and said, "I cannot drink a whole cup.”

夫怒，因嘻笑曰：“将军贵人也，属之!”
灌夫心里生气，嘴里用一种嘲弄的腔调说：“您是贵人，干了这一杯!”
Guan Fu was furious but he forced a smile. “A great man like Your Excellency must drink up!" he cried.

时武安不肯。
田蚡坚持不喝。
Still Tian Fen refused to drink.

行酒次至临汝侯，临汝侯方与程不识耳语,又不避席。
灌夫无法，接着敬酒到了临汝侯灌贤的面前，当时灌贤正在跟程不识咬着耳朵说话，没有注意，又没有离席。
Next Guan Fu went to the marquis of Linru, who was whispering to Cheng Bushi and did not leave his mat either.

夫无所发怒，乃骂临汝侯曰:“生平毁程不识不直一钱，今日长者为寿，乃效女儿咕嗫耳语!”
灌夫满腔怒火正没有地方发泄，于是就指着临汝侯骂道：“平常在底下你也把程不识贬得一钱不值，今天有年纪的人来给你敬酒了，你倒反而和他像小孩子似地叽叽咕咕个没完!”
To vent his anger, Guan Fu swore at him, “You usually run down Cheng Bushi as if he were not worth a cent; yet today when one of your elders offers you a toast, you are whispering into his ear like a girl!”

武安谓灌夫曰：“程李俱东西宫卫尉,今众辱程将军，仲孺独不为李将军地乎?”
田蚡一看赶紧拦阻说：“程不识和李广一起分别在长乐宫和未央宫做卫尉，今天你当众侮辱程将军，难道就不为李将军留点面子吗?”
Tian Fen drew him aside and warned him, “Cheng Bushi and Li Guang are commanders of the guard at the East and West Palaces. If you insult General Cheng in public like this, what must General Li feel?”

灌夫曰：“今日斩头陷匈四，何知程李乎!”
灌夫说：“今天我连砍头穿胸都不怕了，我还顾什么程将军李将军!”
"I am ready to have my head cut off or my chest ripped open," retorted Guan Fu. “What do I care about either Cheng or Li?”

坐乃起更衣，稍稍去。
座上的宾客们一看事情要闹大于是就推说上厕所，一个个地向外溜。
One by one the guests went off to the lavatory and then slipped away.

魏其侯去，麾灌夫出。
这时窦婴也站起来，挥手叫灌夫一起走。
and Dou Ying signed to Guan Fu to go with him.

武安遂怒曰：“此吾骄灌夫罪。”
而田蚡这时已经怒吼说：“这都是我平常对灌夫太迁就，所以他今天才敢这么放肆!”
But Tian Fen exclaimed angrily, “That was my own fault—I let Guan Fu go too far!”

乃令骑留灌夫。灌夫欲出不得。
说罢下令武士拦住灌夫。灌夫这时已经是想走也走不了了。
He ordered his horsemen to detain Guan Fu, so that he could not leave.

籍福起为谢，案灌夫项令谢。
籍福一看就赶快起来帮他们调停，他按着灌夫的脖子想让他向田蚡认个错。
Ji Fu rose to apologize for him, putting a hand on the back of his neck to force him to apologize.

夫愈怒，不肯谢。
而灌夫当时更是火上浇油，坚决不肯。
Then Tian Fen ordered his horsemen to bind him and hold him prisoner.

武安乃麾骑缚夫置传舍,召长史曰:“今日召宗室，有诏。”
于是田蚡就让武士们把灌夫捆起来看守在客馆里，他把自己的长史叫来吩咐说：“今天我请诸位宗室来，是奉了太后的命令。"
Summoning his chief officer, he said, "Today I invited members of the imperial house at the order of the empress dowager.

劾灌夫骂坐不敬，系居室。
于是就让长史起草奏章弹劾灌夫这种辱骂宾客是对太后命令的大不敬，并很快把灌夫关进了监狱。
Because Guan Fu swore at my guests and showed no respect, I have detained him in my house.”

遂按其前事，遣吏分曹逐捕诸灌氏支属，皆得弃市罪。
接着田蚡就收集整理灌夫以往的各种不法行为，迅速派人分头把灌夫家族的各个支派一网打尽，通通地判为死罪。
Then he brought up the old charges against Guan Fu and sent officers to arrest his entire clan, accusing them of capital offences.

魏其侯大愧,为资使宾客请，莫能解。
窦婴这时感到太对不起灌夫了，就百般地花钱请宾客们去说情，结果一概无效。
Dou Ying, bitterly repenting his part in this, laid out money and sent men to beg for Guan Fu's release, but all to no avail.

武安吏皆为耳目，诸灌氏皆亡匿，夫系，遂不得告言武安阴事。
这时田蚡的下属官吏，都为田蚡作耳目，灌夫那些没有被抓起来的党羽们也都逃脱躲藏了起来，灌夫自己又被下在狱里，于是就没法去向皇上揭发田蚡的问题了。
With Tian Fen's officers hot on their track, all the Guans went into hiding; and since Guan Fu himself was under arrest he could not report Tian Fen's misdeeds to the emperor.

魏其锐身为救灌夫。
魏其侯（窦婴）奋不顾身地营救灌夫。
Dou Ying made every effort to save Guan Fu.

夫人谏魏其曰：“灌将军得罪丞相，与太后家忤，宁可救邪?”
他的夫人劝他说：“灌将军得罪了丞相，又和太后家作对，难道还能救得了吗？”
although his wife warned him, “General Guan has offended the prime minister and annoyed the empress dowager and her family. How can you save him?”

魏其侯曰：“侯自我得之，自我捐之，无所恨。且终不令灌仲孺独死，婴独生。”
魏其侯说：“我的爵位是我自己得来的，我自己放弃它，没什么遗憾。而且终究不能让灌仲孺（灌夫）独自死去，我独自活着。”
"I won the title of marquis for myself and can give it up without regret," replied her husband. "I cannot let Guan Fu die while I am alive.”

乃匿其家,窃出上书。
于是他瞒着家里人，偷偷出去给皇上上书。
Unknown to his family, he slipped out and presented a memorial to the throne.

立召人，具言灌夫醉饱事，不足诛。
皇上立即召见他，他详细说明灌夫是因醉酒闹事，罪不至死。
He was immediately summoned to the palace, where he explained that Guan Fu had been drunk during the feast and that this offence should not be punished by death.

上然之，赐魏其食,曰：“东朝廷辩之。”
皇上认为他说得对，赏他吃饭，说：“到东宫去当众辩论这件事。”
The emperor agreed and kept him to a meal, then said, “Go and argue your case now in the East Empress Dowager's Court."

魏其之东朝，盛推灌夫之善，言其醉饱得过，乃丞相以他事诬罪之。
魏其侯到了东宫，极力称赞灌夫的优点，说他是因醉酒有过失，而丞相是用其他事情诬陷他定罪。
So Dou Ying went to the East Court. There he stressed Guan Fu's good qualities, admitted that he had drunk too much, but declared that the prime minister was now bringing false charges against him.

武安又盛毁灌夫所为横恣，罪逆不道。
武安侯（田蚡）又极力诋毁灌夫行为蛮横放纵，犯了大逆不道之罪。
Thereupon Tian Fen expatiated at length on Guan Fu's arrogance and lawlessness, declaring him guilty of treason.

魏其度不可奈何，因言丞相短。
魏其侯估量无法反驳，于是就揭发丞相的短处。
Since Dou Ying feared he could not refute these charges, he started enumerating the prime minister's own faults.

武安曰：“天下幸而安乐无事，蚡得为肺腑，所好音乐狗马田宅。蚡所爱倡优巧匠之属，不如魏其、灌夫日夜招聚天下豪桀壮士与论议，腹诽而心谤，不仰视天而俯画地,辟倪两宫间,幸天下有变，而欲有大功。臣乃不知魏其等所为。”
武安侯说：“天下幸好安定无事，我得以作为皇亲，喜好的是音乐、狗马、田宅。我喜爱的是歌舞艺人、工匠这类人，不像魏其侯、灌夫那样日夜招集天下豪杰壮士，一起议论，心中不满、暗中诽谤，不是仰观天象就是俯画地形，在东宫、西宫之间窥伺，希望天下发生变故，好趁机立下大功。我真不知道魏其侯等人在做什么。”
Tian Fen replied, "Fortunately the world is at peace now so that I, as a relative of the imperial house, can enjoy music, horses, hounds and my estate. I am fond of musicians, actors and craftsmen, unlike Dou Ying and Guan Fu who day and night gather adventurers and powerful men from all parts of the land to plot together, taunting and slandering others behind their backs, searching the heavens for omens and sketching their plans of campaign on the ground, manoeuvring between the emperor and empress dowager, and hoping for unrest so that they can achieve great deeds. I cannot tell what Dou Ying and that crew are up to."

于是上问朝臣：“两人孰是?”
于是皇上问朝中大臣：“他们两人谁对？”
The emperor asked his ministers, "Which of these two is right?"

御史大夫韩安国曰：“魏其言灌夫父死事，身荷戟驰入不测之吴军，身被数十创，名冠三军，此天下壮士，非有大恶,争杯酒，不足引他过以诛也。魏其言是也。
御史大夫韩安国说：“魏其侯说灌夫的父亲战死，灌夫手持长戟冲入生死难料的吴军，身上受了几十处伤，名声在三军之中第一，这是天下的壮士，没有大的罪过，只是因酒宴争执，不值得牵连其他过错来处死他。魏其侯说得对。
The grand secretary Han Anguo said, "Dou Ying, the marquis of Weiqi, has told us how Guan Fu after his father's death seized his spear and, blind to danger, charged the ranks of Wu. He received a dozen wounds and his fame spread throughout the army as one of the bravest fighters in all the land. Now he has committed no serious crime in simply brawling over a cup of wine, and we should not execute him for other faults. In this respect, the marquis of Weiqi is right.

丞相亦言灌夫通奸猾，侵细民，家累巨万，横恣颍川，凌铄宗室，侵犯骨肉,此所谓‘枝大于本，胫大于股，不折必披’,丞相言亦是。唯明主裁之。”
丞相也说灌夫勾结奸猾之人，侵害百姓，家产积累上万万，在颍川横行霸道，欺压宗室，侵犯皇亲，这就是所说的‘树枝比树干大，小腿比大腿粗，不折断就会破裂’，丞相说得也对。请英明的君主裁决。”
"The prime minister, however, tells us that Guan Fu is in league with evil men, has oppressed the common people, amassed millions, tyrannized over Yingchuan, and even insulted members of the imperial house, encroaching upon their rights. When the branch is larger than the trunk, it will destroy the tree unless it is broken off. Thus the prime minister is also right. Only our sagacious sovereign can decide between them.”

主爵都尉汲黯是魏其。
主爵都尉汲黯赞同魏其侯。
Ji An, the officer in charge of principalities, spoke in favour of Dou Ying.

内史郑当时是魏其，后不敢坚对。
内史郑当时起初赞同魏其侯，后来不敢坚决坚持。
The city prefect, Zheng Dangshi, spoke up for him too but dared not make out a strong case.

余皆莫敢对。
其余的人都不敢回答。
All the others were afraid to speak at all.

上怒内史曰：“公平生数言魏其、武安长短，今日廷论，局趣效辕下驹,吾并斩若属矣。”
皇上对内史发怒说：“你平时多次议论魏其侯、武安侯的长处和短处，今天在朝廷上辩论，却畏缩得像车辕下的小马驹，我把你们都杀了！”
The emperor was angry and swore at Zheng Dangshi, "You usually have plenty to say about the good points and bad of Dou Ying and Tian Fen. Yet in a debate at court you are like a pony caught between shafts. I should have the lot of you beheaded."

即罢起入，上食太后。
随即结束朝会，皇上起身进入内宫，侍奉太后吃饭。
Emperor Wu dismissed the court and went to the inner apartments to offer food to the empress dowager.

太后亦已使人候伺，具以告太后。
太后也已派人探听消息，（探听的人）把情况详细告诉了太后。
But her spies had already told her about the debate.

太后怒，不食，曰：“今我在也，而人皆藉吾弟,令我百岁后，皆鱼肉之矣。且帝宁能为石人邪!此特帝在，即录录,设百岁后，是属宁有可信者乎?”
太后发怒，不吃饭，说：“现在我还活着，人们就都欺辱我的弟弟；等我死后，人们都会把他当作鱼肉来宰割了。况且皇上难道能像石头人一样长生不老吗！现在皇上还在，就如此没有主见，假如皇上死后，这些人难道有可以信赖的吗？”
and she was too angry to eat. "Even while I am alive they are trampling on my younger brother!" she scolded. "As soon as I am dead they will swallow him up! And do you expect to last as long as a stone statue? If you give way so meekly in your lifetime, after your death which one of these men can be trusted?”

上谢曰：“俱宗室外家,故廷辩之。不然，此一狱吏所决耳。”
皇上道歉说：“他们都是宗室和外戚，所以在朝廷上辩论。不然的话，这种事一个狱吏就能裁决了。”
The emperor apologized and said, "It is because they are both related to the imperial house that I had this debate in court. Otherwise such matters could be decided by any law officer."

是时郎中令石建为上分别言两人事。
这时郎中令石建向皇上详细分析了两人的事情。
Then Shijian, chief of the palace guards, analysed the two men's cases for the emperor.

颍阴侯言之上，上以夫为中郎将。
灌何（颍阴侯）回朝后向景帝汇报了灌夫的表现，景帝任命灌夫为中郎将。
The marquis of Yingyin reported this to the emperor, who made Guan Fu general of the palace guard.

数月，坐法去。
结果只干了几个月，就因为犯法被免职了。
A few months later, however, he was dismissed for some offence.

后家居长安，长安中诸公莫弗称之。
后来他搬家到长安居住，长安城里的有声望之人没有不称赞他的。
He made his home in the capital and everyone in Chang'an spoke highly of him.

孝景时，至代相。
孝景帝时期，灌夫官至代国丞相。
During the reign of Emperor Jing he was appointed as chief minister of the principality of Dai.

孝景崩，今上初即位，以为淮阳天下交，劲兵处，故徙夫为淮阳太守。
孝景帝去世，当今皇上（武帝）刚即位，认为淮阳是天下的交通枢纽、军事要地，所以调灌夫任淮阳太守。
After Emperor Jing died and the present emperor had just come to the throne, Guan Fu was appointed as governor of Huaiyang because that was a centre of communications and a military stronghold.

建元元年，入为太仆。
武帝建元元年，灌夫被调进京城任太仆。
In the first year of Jianyuan, he served as minister of the imperial equipage.

二年，夫与长乐卫尉窦甫饮，轻重不得，夫醉，搏甫。
建元二年，灌夫和长乐卫尉窦甫一起饮酒，因饮酒时礼数或言语不当起了争执，灌夫喝醉后殴打了窦甫。
The next year while drinking one day with Dou Fu, commander of the Changle Palace guard, Guan Fu quarrelled with him and, being in his cups, struck him.

甫，窦太后昆弟也。
窦甫，是窦太后的兄弟。
Dou Fu was the younger brother of Empress Dowager Dou.

上恐太后诛夫，徙为燕相。
武帝怕窦太后杀灌夫，就调灌夫任燕国丞相。
Afraid the empress dowager might have Guan Fu killed, the emperor transferred him to be the chief minister of the principality of Yan.

数岁，坐法去官，家居长安。
几年后，灌夫又因犯法丢官，在长安家中闲居。
Several years later he was dismissed for some offence and returned to the capital to live in retirement.

灌夫为人刚直使酒，不好面谀。
灌夫为人刚强正直，常因饮酒发脾气，不喜欢当面讨好别人。
Guan Fu was strong-willed, outspoken and boisterous when drunk. He never flattered anybody.

贵戚诸有势在己之右，不欲加礼，必陵之；
对那些地位、权势比自己高的皇亲贵戚，他不愿以礼相待，反而必定要欺辱他们；
He behaved in a cavalier and insulting way to nobles and all who were more powerful than himself.

诸士在己之左，愈贫贱，尤益敬，与钧。
对那些地位比自己低的士人，越是贫贱的，他就越是敬重，与他们平等相待。
but treated those below him as his equals—the poorer they were, the more respect he showed.

稠人广众，荐宠下辈。
在大庭广众之中，他特别喜欢推荐、表扬地位比自己低的人。
In a large group he always singled out his inferiors for attention.

士亦以此多之。
士人也因此称赞他。
and gentlemen admired him for this trait.

夫不喜文学，好任侠，已然诺。
灌夫不喜欢儒家学说，喜好行侠仗义，凡是答应别人的事必定兑现。
He had no taste for literature but admired gallant deeds of daring and kept his word without fail.

诸所与交通，无非豪杰大猾。
他所结交的人，无一不是豪杰或有势力的精明人。
All his friends were prominent citizens or men of great resourcefulness.

家累数千万，食客日数十百人。
家中积累的财产有几千万，每天来投奔的食客有几十上百人。
His property ran into tens of millions of cash, and he daily entertained tens and hundreds of guests.

陂池田园，宗族宾客为权利，横于颍川。
（灌夫家有）池塘、田地，他的宗族和宾客借着他的权势谋求私利，在颍川郡横行霸道。
His estates were large, including hills, lakes and fields, and he had a host of kinsmen and protegés. His power went unchallenged in Yingchuan.

颍川儿乃歌之曰：“颍水清，灌氏宁；颍水浊，灌氏族。”
颍川的儿童于是唱道：“颍水清清，灌氏安宁；颍水浑浊，灌氏灭族。”
where the children used to sing: "When the River Ying runs clear, The Guans have nothing to fear; When the River Ying runs muddy, The Guans' end will be bloody!"

灌夫家居虽富，然失势，卿相侍中宾客益衰。
灌夫虽在家闲居且富有，但因失势，过去来往的卿相、侍中之类的宾客越来越少了。
But although Guan Fu was wealthy, his power declined once he was out of office and the ministers, courtiers and protégés who had associated with him stayed away.

及魏其侯失势，亦欲倚灌夫引绳批根生平慕之后弃之者。
等到魏其侯窦婴失势，（窦婴）也想依靠灌夫去整治那些原先仰慕自己、后来又抛弃自己的人。
So when Dou Ying also lost power, he was eager to join forces with Guan Fu and sever relations with those former admirers who had now deserted him.

灌夫亦倚魏其而通列侯宗室为名高。
灌夫也想依靠魏其侯（的关系）结交列侯、宗室，来提高自己的声望。
Guan Fu for his part hoped with the help of Dou Ying to make friends with other nobles and imperial clansmen and so increase his reputation.

两人相为引重，其游如父子然。
两人互相扶持、推崇，相处得像父子一样。
The mutual attraction and admiration they felt made the two men as close as father and son.

相得欢甚，无厌，恨相知晚也。
（他们）相处得非常融洽，没有厌倦，只恨相识得太晚。
They got on capitally together, never tiring of each other's company; they only regretted that they had not met earlier.

武安已罢朝，出止车门，召韩御史大夫载，怒曰：“与长孺共一老秃翁，何为首鼠两端？”
田蚡退朝以后，从止车门出来，招呼韩安国上了他的车子，怒气冲冲地说：“我跟你共同对付一个老秃头，你为什么这么模棱两可，畏首畏尾呢？”
When the court was dismissed Tian Fen went to find his carriage at the gate and made the grand secretary Han Anguo ride with him. “What made you dither like a mouse poking his head out of his hole when dealing with that old bald pate?" he demanded angrily.

韩御史良久谓丞相曰：“君何不自喜？夫魏其毁君，君当免冠解印绶归，曰‘臣以肺腑幸得待罪，固非其任，魏其言皆是'。如此，上必多君有让，不废君。魏其必内愧，杜门蜡舌自杀。今人毁君，君亦毁人，譬如贾竖女子争言，何其无大体也！”
韩安国沉默了一会儿才对田蚡说：“您为什么不知道自重呢？当魏其侯攻击您的时候您应当摘下帽子，把您的印绶交还皇上，您可以说：‘我只因为是皇上的亲戚才一时充当了丞相，我本来就担当不了这样的重任，魏其侯说的那些话都对。’这样一来，皇上一定会赞扬您的谦让，绝不会剥夺您的相位。而魏其侯在这种情况下也一定会深感内疚，会羞得他回去关上门子咬烂舌头自杀。可是您呢，人家攻击您，您也攻击人家，就如同小商贩、老娘们那样在那里争吵，怎么就这么不识大体呢？”
After a considerable silence Han Anguo replied, "Why couldn't you keep your temper? When Dou Ying attacked you, you should have taken off your official cap and seal and handed in your resignation, saying,' As a relative of the imperial family I have had the privilege of serving Your Majesty but proved unworthy of my post. The marquis of Weiqi is right.' The emperor would not have accepted your modesty so much that he would not have accepted your resignation, while Dou Ying would have been so ashamed that he would have locked himself up, bitten out his tongue and taken his own life. Instead, you hurled back abuse when he abused you as if this were a squabble between hawkers or women. It was most undignified.”

武安谢罪曰：“争时急，不知出此。”
田蚡一听恍然大悟说：“当时只顾了争吵，没有想到该这么做。”
Tian Fen excused himself, saying, "In the heat of the moment that never occurred to me."

于是上使御史簿责魏其所言灌夫，颇不雠，欺谩。劾系都司空。
于是武帝派御史拿着案卷去责问窦婴，说他所讲的灌夫的情况，与事实不符，说他是欺骗皇上。于是窦婴受到弹劾也被关进了都司空的监牢里。
The emperor ordered the censorate to verify Dou Ying's statements about Guan Fu, and when these were found to be untrue he was impeached and imprisoned by the gaoler of the imperial clan.

孝景时，魏其常受遗诏，曰“事有不便，以便宜论上”。及系，灌夫罪至族，事日急，诸公莫敢复明言于上。
早在孝景帝在世时，窦婴曾得到过孝景帝的一篇遗诏，其中说“当发生了什么不利的事情时，可以直接向皇上启奏”。等到魏其侯被关起来，灌夫被判为灭族的时候，事情非常紧急，朝廷里的大臣们谁也不敢再去向皇上说明事情的真相了。
During the reign of Emperor Jing, Dou Ying had received an imperial decree saying that any serious offence he might have committed should be dealt with leniently when tried. Now that he was in prison and Guan Fu had been arrested and condemned to death with his whole family, the situation was growing daily more ominous, yet nobody dared to intercede with the emperor.

魏其乃使昆弟子上书言之，幸得复召见。书奏上，而案尚书，大行无遗诏。诏书独藏魏其家，家丞封。乃劾魏其矫先帝诏，罪当弃市。
这时窦婴就让他的侄子给武帝上奏，说了他家存有先帝遗诏的事情，希望得到皇上的召见。奏章交给武帝后，武帝派人到尚书处查阅案卷，没有发现景帝遗诏的存根。只有一张诏书藏在窦婴的家中，是由他们的家臣加印封存的。于是田蚡等又进而弹劾窦婴假造先帝的遗诏，罪该杀头。
So Dou Ying made his brother’s son mention the decree he had received, thus hoping to have an audience with the emperor. But the imperial secretariat could find no such decree left by the previous emperor at the time of his death. The only copy was that in the possession of Dou Ying, sealed by his family steward. Accordingly he was charged with forging an imperial decree, a capital offence.

五年十月，悉论灌夫及家属。魏其良久乃闻，闻即恚，病痱，不食欲死。
于是在元光五年十月，灌夫及其整个家族全部被处死。窦婴在监狱里过了很久才听到这个消息，他一听说悲痛欲绝，当时就中了风，而且绝食准备自杀。
In the tenth month of the fifth year of Yuanguang, Guan Fu and all his family were executed. When Dou Ying subsequently learned of this, he was so enraged that he had an epileptic fit and tried to starve himself to death.

或闻上无意杀魏其，魏其复食，治病，议定不死矣。乃有蜚语为恶言闻上，故以十二月晦论弃市渭城。
后来又听说皇上没有杀窦婴的意思，于是就又开始吃饭，请医生给自己治病，后来果然传出消息说是朝廷议定不杀窦婴了。可是紧接着又腾起一股恶毒的流言蜚语传到了皇帝那里，于是在这一年的十二月三十，魏其侯窦婴在渭城被弃市了。
But hearing that Emperor Wu did not mean to kill him, he started eating and taking medicine again. It had been decided that his life should be spared, but then a rumour reached the emperor to the effect that Dou Ying was slandering him. He was therefore condemned to be executed at the end of the twelfth month in Weicheng.

其春，武安侯病，专呼服谢罪。使巫视鬼者视之，见魏其、灌夫共守，欲杀之。竟死。
也就在这同一年的春天，田蚡也生了病，他一个劲地呼叫着“我有罪我服罪”。待至请来巫师一看，巫师说他看见魏其侯和灌夫两个鬼魂夹守在他的两旁，是这两个鬼魂想要弄死他。结果田蚡就这样地死去了。
The following spring Tian Fen fell ill and kept crying out to beg forgiveness for his crimes. A sorcerer who could see spirits was sent for, and he saw the ghosts of Dou Ying and Guan Fu watching over Tian Fen and waiting for a chance to kill him. And so he died.

子恬嗣。元朔三年，武安侯坐衣檐榆入宫，不敬。
田蚡的儿子田恬继承了武安侯的爵位。到元朔三年时，田恬因为穿着短衫进宫，犯了不敬之罪，封邑被废除。
His son Tian Tian succeeded to his title. In the winter of the third year of Yuanshuo, this second marquis of Wuan was found guilty of disrespect to the throne because he wore a short tunic to the palace. Thereupon the fief was abolished.

淮南王安谋反觉,治。
后来淮南王刘安的谋反被发觉，武帝命令严加追究。
After the prince of Huainan's plot to rebel was discovered and investigated.

王前朝,武安侯为太尉，时迎王至霸上,谓王曰：“上未有太子，大王最贤，高祖孙，即宫车晏驾，非大王立当谁哉!”
这时才发现刘安前些年进京朝贡时，武安侯当时正做太尉，在他到霸上迎接刘安时，曾对刘安说：“现在皇上还没有太子，您为人贤明，又是高祖的孙子，假如皇上有一天死了，那时不立您还去立谁呢!"
it emerged that previously, when he had come to court, Tian Fen, then grand marshal, had welcomed him at Bashang. "The emperor has no heir and Your Highness is the ablest of the First Emperor's grandsons," said Tian Fen. "When the emperor dies, you should naturally succeed him.”

淮南王大喜，厚遗金财物。
刘安听了很高兴，送给了田蚡许多金银财物。
The prince was so pleased that he presented Tian Fen with much gold and other gifts.

上自魏其时不直武安,特为太后故耳。
另外武帝本人也是早从窦婴被杀时就不认为田蚡有理，只不过是由于太后偏袒而不能处置他罢了。
Emperor Wu had been prejudiced against Tian Fen ever since he destroyed Dou Ying and had only put up with him for the sake of the empress dowager.

及闻淮南王金事，上曰：“使武安侯在者，族矣。”
等到这回一听说田蚡接受过淮南王的贿赂时，就说：“假使武安侯现在还活着，一定要灭了他满门。”
When he heard about these gifts from the prince of Huainan, he declared, "If Tian Fen were still alive today I should have executed him and all his family.”

太史公曰：魏其、武安皆以外戚重，灌夫用一时决策而名显。
太史公说：魏其侯、武安侯都是靠外戚的身份而得以显贵的，灌夫因为偶然的一次冒险决断而名声显赫。
The Grand Historian comments: Both Dou Ying and Tian Fen rose to power because they were related to an empress. Guan Fu won fame for a single daring exploit.

魏其之举以吴、楚，武安之贵在日月之际。
魏其侯是因为吴、楚之乱得以提升，武安侯则是利用了太后和皇上共同掌权的机会而得以显贵。
Dou Ying was promoted after the rebellion of Wu and Chu, and Tian Fen became prominent at a time when the emperor was young and the empress dowager wielded power.

然魏其诚不知时变，灌夫无术而不逊，两人相翼，乃成祸乱。
然而魏其侯太不懂得时势的变化，灌夫又不学无术，不知谦逊，这两个人相互翼护，于是酿成大祸。
But Dou Ying did not know how to change with the times, while Guan Fu was overbearing and tactless. Each, by aiding the other, brought calamity on himself.

武安负贵而好权，杯酒责望，陷彼两贤。
武安侯倚仗显贵的地位而喜好权势，为了一杯酒的怨气，就陷害了两个有才能的人。
Tian Fen took advantage of his high position to display his power, destroying two good men because of a quarrel over a cup of wine.

呜呼哀哉!迁怒及人，命亦不延。
唉，可惜呀!因小事迁怒别人，自己的性命也一定不能长久。
The pity of it! One who vents his anger on an innocent party will not long survive.

众庶不载，竟被恶言。
广大民众不支持，终于受到恶言中伤。
Those who lack popular support must fall prey to slander.

呜呼哀哉!祸所从来矣!
唉，太可悲了!灾祸就是这样来的啊!
Alas, disaster never strikes without cause!
