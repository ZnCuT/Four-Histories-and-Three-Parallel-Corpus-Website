韩子曰：“儒以文乱法，而侠以武犯禁。”二者皆讥，而学士多称于世云。
韩非子说：“儒生用文辞扰乱法度，游侠用武力违犯禁令。”两种人都被他批评，但儒生却大多在世上被称赞。
Han Fei Zi has said, “Confucian scholars with their writings confuse the law, gallant citizens with their weapons infringe the rules." But although Han Fei Zi ridicules both, Confucian scholars often win praise in the world.

至如以术取宰相卿大夫，辅翼其世主，功名俱著于春秋，固无可言者。
至于那些凭借儒术当上宰相、卿大夫，辅佐君主，功名被记载在史书上的人，本来就没什么可多说的。
We need not speak of those who through their arts rise to become prime ministers or high officials assisting their sovereigns, those whose feats and fame are recorded in the annals of the state.

及若季次、原宪，闾巷人也，读书怀独行君子之德，义不苟合当世，当世亦笑之。
至于像季次、原宪这样的民间读书人，他们读书时坚守君子的独特品德，坚守道义不与世俗苟合，当时的人也嘲笑他们。
But men like Ji Ci and Yuan Xian were ordinary citizens engaged in studying the classics, who held aloof from the world and practiced the virtues of a gentleman. Too upright to pander to the age, they were laughed at in their day.

故季次、原宪终身空室蓬户，褐衣疏食不厌。死而已四百余年，而弟子志之不倦。
所以季次、原宪一辈子住在空荡的茅屋中，粗布衣服、简陋饭食也不满足。他们死后四百多年，弟子们仍然不断铭记他们。
They lived all their lives in bare rooms with matting doors, content with coarse garments and the simplest fare. Now more than four hundred years have passed since their death, yet their disciples still commemorate them.

今游侠，其行虽不轨于正义，然其言必信，其行必果，已诺必诚，不爱其躯，赴士之厄困，既已存亡死生矣，而不矜其能，羞伐其德，盖亦有足多者焉。
如今的游侠，他们的行为虽然不符合正道，但他们说话一定守信，做事一定有结果，承诺必定真诚，不惜牺牲自己，解救士人的危难，在让人脱离死亡、保全生命后，却不夸耀自己的才能，羞于宣扬自己的恩德，大概也有值得称赞的地方。
As for the gallant citizens, although they do not always do what is right, their word can be trusted. They keep all their promises, honour all their pledges, and hasten to rescue those in distress regardless of their own safety. They risk their lives without boasting, not stooping to speak of their good deeds. So there is much to be said for them.

且缓急，人之所时有也。
况且紧急情况，是人们时常会遇到的。
In days gone by... (此处结合后文，补充完整语义) Emergency situations are something everyone may encounter from time to time.

昔者虞舜窘于井廪，伊尹负于鼎俎，傅说匿于傅险，吕尚困于棘津，夷吾桎梏，百里饭牛，仲尼畏匡，菜色陈、蔡。
从前虞舜在水井和粮仓中受困，伊尹背着鼎俎做厨师，傅说隐藏在傅险（做苦役），吕尚在棘津受困，管仲被戴上脚镣手铐，百里奚给人喂牛，孔子在匡地受威胁，在陈国、蔡国饿得面黄肌瘦。
Emperor Shun was trapped in a well and caught in a granary; Yi Yin toiled as a scullion; Fu Yue worked as a convict at Fuxian; Lü Shang sold food at Jijin; Guan Zhong was shackled; Baili Xi herded cattle; Confucius was threatened by the men of Kuang and grew pale from hunger in Chen and Cai.

此皆学士所谓有道仁人也，犹然遭此菑，况以中材而涉乱世之末流乎？其遇害何可胜道哉！
这些都是学者所说的有道德的仁人，尚且遭遇这样的灾难，何况是中等才能的人，又处在乱世的衰败时期呢？他们遭受的灾祸怎么能说得完呢！
If such hardships befell these men so esteemed by scholars for their moral character, there must be no end to the sufferings of men of lesser stature who live in decadent and troubled times.

鄙人有言曰：“何知仁义，已飨其利者为有德。”
老百姓有句话说：“哪知道什么仁义，自己得到好处的人就是有德行的。”
The common people say, "Don't talk about humanity and justice. Whoever does you a good turn is a good man."

故伯夷丑周，饿死首阳山，而文武不以其故贬王；跖、蹻暴戾，其徒诵义无穷。
所以伯夷认为周朝（伐纣）可耻，饿死在首阳山，但周文王、周武王的王业并不因此被贬损；盗跖、庄蹻凶狠残暴，他们的门徒却不断称颂他们的道义。
So although Bo Yi so hated the Zhou Dynasty that he starved to death on Shouyang Mountain, people thought none the worse of King Wen and King Wu. Although Zhi and Jiao were cruel brigand chiefs, their followers extolled their merits.

由此观之，“窃钩者诛，窃国者侯，侯之门仁义存”，非虚言也。
由此看来，“偷钩子的人被处死，偷国家的人封侯，诸侯的门庭里才有仁义”，这话不是假话。
This illustrates the truth of the saying, "The man who steals a knife is killed but the man who steals a kingdom is ennobled, and virtue and justice are on the side of the nobles.”

今拘学或抱咫尺之义，久孤于世，岂若卑论侪俗，与世沉浮而取荣名哉！
如今有些拘泥于学问的人，坚守微小的道义，长久地在世上孤立，哪里比得上降低论调、迎合世俗，随波逐流来获取荣耀名声呢！
Scrupulous, punctilious scholars isolate themselves from the world, when they could win glory and fame by lowering themselves to the level of the vulgar and pandering to the fashions of the time.

而布衣之徒，设取予然诺，千里诵义，为死不顾世，此亦有所长，非苟而已也。
但平民出身的人，在取予和承诺上坚守原则，千里之外的人都称颂他们的道义，为道义献身而不顾世人看法，这也有他们的长处，不是随便就能做到的。
But when common citizens pledge themselves to a just cause and will travel a thousand li to die for it, not caring what the world thinks, this has its merits too. Such men have not lived for nothing.

故士穷窘而得委命，此岂非人之所谓贤豪间者邪？
所以士人在穷困窘迫时能把性命托付给他们，这难道不是人们所说的贤能豪杰一类的人吗？
That is why people who are hard pressed entrust their fate to them, for these are worthy and outstanding men.

诚使乡曲之侠，予季次、原宪比权量力，效功于当世，不同日而论矣。
如果真的让乡里的游侠，和季次、原宪比较权势和能力，以及对当世的贡献，那是不能相提并论的。
Indeed, if we compare the power and influence of these gallant citizens with Ji Ci and Yuan Xian's, they render society a much greater service.

要以功见言信，侠客之义又曷可少哉！
总之，从办事有成效、说话守信用来看，侠客的道义又怎么能缺少呢！
The main thing is that they do all they promise, proving as good as their word. How can the world belittle such men?

古布衣之侠，靡得而闻已。
古代平民之侠的事迹，已经没办法知道了。
The names of gallant citizens of ancient times are lost.

近世孟尝、春申、平原、信陵之徒，皆因王者亲属，藉于有土卿相之富厚，招天下贤者，显名诸侯，不可谓不贤者矣。
近代的孟尝君、春申君、平原君、信陵君等人，都因为是国君的亲属，凭借他们封地的收入和卿相的地位，招揽天下的贤士，使自己扬名于诸侯，这不能说他们不是贤能的人。
In recent ages there have been men like Lord Mengchang, Lord Chunshen, Lord Pingyuan and Lord Xinling, all related to royal houses or high ministers with rich fiefs, who used their wealth to gather men of talent from all parts of the empire to spread their fame through the states. These were certainly worthy men.

比如顺风而呼，声非加疾，其势激也。
但这好比顺着风向呼喊，声音没有加强，但风势却使声音显得很响，传得很远。
but their winning themselves fame was like calling down the wind: even if the sound itself was not loud, the wind carried it a long way.

至如闾巷之侠，修行砥名，声施于天下，莫不称贤，是为难耳。
至于平民之侠，他们是靠着修炼自己的品德，提高自己的名节，来扬名于天下，博得天下人的称赞的，这才是不容易的呀！
It was much more difficult for the common citizens to practise virtue till their fame spread everywhere and their praise was on all lips.

然儒、墨皆排摈不载。
然而儒家和墨家的著作都不记载他们的事迹。
These men were brushed aside, moreover, by both Confucians and Mohists, who scorned to record their actions.

自秦以前，匹夫之侠，湮灭不见，余甚恨之。
使秦朝以前的平民之侠的事迹都埋没了，真叫人遗憾。
That is why these gallant citizens who lived before the Qin Dynasty are lost in oblivion—much to my regret.

以余所闻，汉兴有朱家、田仲、王公、剧孟、郭解之徒，虽时扞当世之文罔，然其私义廉洁退让，有足称者。
据我所知，汉朝建立以来，有朱家、田仲、王公、剧孟、郭解等人，这些人虽然有时触犯国家的法律，但是他们的道德信义和廉洁谦让的人品，有值得称赞之处。
From what I have heard, men like Zhu Jia, Tian Zhong, Wang Meng, Ju Meng and Guo Xie at the beginning of the Han Dynasty were admirably honest, scrupulous and modest in their private lives although they often broke the law of their time.

名不虚立，士不虚附。
他们的名声不是凭空吹起来的，人们依附他们也不是无缘无故的。
Their fame was well deserved and it was not for nothing that others sought their protection.

至如朋党宗强比周，设财役贫，豪暴侵凌孤弱，恣欲自快，游侠亦丑之。
至于那些结党营私的强宗豪族，他们彼此勾结，依仗家财奴役穷人，凭借权势欺负孤弱，肆无忌惮地为所欲为，真正的游侠对他们也是鄙视的。
As for those gangs and powerful families who band together and use their wealth to enslave the poor and bully the weak and helpless, with no thought of anything but their own pleasure, such men are also despised by the gallant citizens.

余悲世俗不察其意，而猥以朱家、郭解等令与暴豪之徒同类而共笑之也。
我感叹世人竟看不出上述两种人的区别，竟然错误地把朱家、郭解等同那些土豪恶霸们混在一起而加以嘲笑。
I consider it a pity that no distinction is generally made between the two, and that men class Zhu Jia and Guo Xie with those local bullies and sneer at both groups.

鲁朱家者，与高祖同时。
鲁国的朱家，是汉高祖那个时候的人。
Zhu Jia of Lu lived during the reign of Emperor Gaozu.

鲁人皆以儒教，而朱家用侠闻。
鲁国人都喜欢讲儒术，而朱家却是以任侠闻名。
but while most men of Lu observe the teachings of Confucius, Zhu Jia made a name as a gallant man.

所藏活豪士以百数，其余庸人不可胜言。
先后被他掩护救活的，光豪杰之士就有几百人之多，其他一般的人就无法计算了。
He protected and saved several hundred eminent men, to say nothing of ordinary people.

然终不伐其能，歆其德，诸所尝施，唯恐见之。
但他从不自我夸耀，自我欣赏。凡是被他救助过的人，他都尽量避免与他们再见面。
Yet he never boasted of his ability or made much of his kindness. He tried, indeed, to avoid those whom he had helped.

振人不赡，先从贫贱始。
他救济人，总是先从最贫困的开始。
In aiding those in distress he started with the poor and humble.

家无余财，衣不完采，食不重味，乘不过输牛。
他自己家里没有任何多余的钱财，穿的衣服又破又旧，吃饭桌上从没见过两盘菜，出门坐的是牛车。
There was no spare money in his home, his clothes were shabby and faded, he ate no more than one dish at each meal and travelled in a small ox-cart.

专趋人之急，甚己之私。
但是他奔救别人的危急，超过了自己的一切。
He devoted himself to helping those in urgent need, putting others' troubles above his own.

既阴脱季布将军之厄，及布尊贵，终身不见也。
他曾在暗中帮助季布将军解脱了困境，等到季布地位尊贵了，朱家到死也没有再去看他。
He secretly aided General Ji Bu when he was in trouble, but after Ji Bu became a great nobleman, Zhu Jia never went to see him.

自关以东，莫不延颈愿交焉。
因此函谷关以东的人们，没有一个不企慕他，希望和他交朋友。
All who lived east of the Hangu Pass craned their necks in their eagerness to get to know him.

楚田仲以侠闻，喜剑，父事朱家，自以为行弗及。
楚国的田仲也以任侠闻名，他喜欢击剑，对待朱家像对待父亲一样，觉得自己的行为远远赶不上朱家。
Tian Zhong of Chu, who made a name as a gallant man and loved swordsmanship, looked up to Zhu Jia as to his father and regarded himself as much inferior.

田仲已死，而雒阳有剧孟。
田仲死后，雒阳又出了个剧孟。
After Tian Zhong's death there was Ju Meng of Luoyang.

周人以商贾为资，而剧孟以任侠显诸侯。
雒阳人本来都靠着经商为生，而剧孟却以好打抱不平而扬名于各郡国。
Most of the men of Zhou were traders, but Ju Meng won fame among the feudal lords by his gallant deeds of daring.

吴楚反时，条侯为太尉，乘传车将至河南，得剧孟，喜曰：“吴楚举大事而不求孟，吾知其无能为已矣。”
吴楚七国之乱时，条侯周亚夫做太尉，他正乘着驿车到河南去，半路上遇到了剧孟，高兴地说：“吴楚造反居然没有想到把剧孟找去，我可以断定他们成不了什么大气候了。”
When the princes of Wu and Chu rebelled, Zhou Yafu the marquis of Tiao was made the grand marshal. As he was approaching Henan by relay carriages, he was delighted to meet Ju Meng and said, "The princes of Wu and Chu have raised a rebellion without seeking out Ju Meng. Now I know they will not accomplish anything."

天下骚动，宰相得之，若得一敌国云。
当时天下动乱，周亚夫得到剧孟，就像得到了一个与自己势均力敌的国家一样喜悦。
For in those unsettled times a prime minister considered Ju Meng's help as equivalent to the conquest of an enemy state.

剧孟行大类朱家，而好博，多少年之戏。
剧孟的行为很像朱家，但喜好六博，大多是青年人玩的游戏。
Ju Meng behaved like Zhu Jia, except that he was fond of gambling and other young men’s amusements.

然剧孟母死，自远方送丧盖千乘。
剧孟的母亲死时，从远方来奔丧的马车差不多有千余辆。
When his mother died, about a thousand carriages came from distant parts to the funeral.

及剧孟死，家无余十金之财。
等到剧孟死时，家里没有十锭黄铜的遗产。
When Ju Meng himself died, his family was left without so much as ten pieces of gold.

而符离人王孟亦以侠称江淮之间。
当时还有个符离人王孟，也以任侠闻名于江淮一带。
Wang Meng of Fuli was also famed as a gallant citizen between the Yangtze and the Huai Rivers.

是时济南晌氏、陈周庸亦以豪闻,景帝闻之，使使尽诛此属。
当时，济南的晌氏、陈县的周庸，也以豪侠闻名，汉景帝听说后，就派人把他们全都杀掉了。
Men of the Jian family of Jinan and Zhou Yong of Chen were also known at that time for their gallant deeds. When Emperor Jing learned of this, he sent and had them killed.

其后代诸白、梁韩无辟、阳翟薛兄、郏韩孺纷纷复出焉。
后来代县有几个姓白的、梁地有韩无辟、阳翟有薛兄、郏县有韩孺等，又纷纷出现了。
They were followed later by others like the Bai family in Dai, Han Wubi of Liang, Xue Kuang of Yangdi and Han Ru of Shan.

少时阴贼，慨不快意,身所杀甚众。
他少年时残忍狠毒，稍不如意就动手杀人，被他杀掉的人很多。
In his youth he was sullen and vindictive. He killed many men when his anger was aroused.

以躯借交报仇,藏命作奸剽攻,休乃铸钱掘冢,固不可胜数。
他不惜豁出命去为朋友报仇，又常窝藏亡命，犯法抢劫，以及私造钱币，挖掘坟墓等，难以指说。
but would risk his life to avenge friends. He sheltered outlaws, conspired against the authorities, was always going in for armed robbery, and was guilty time and again of counterfeiting money and robbing tombs.

适有天幸，窘急常得脱，若遇赦。
但他运气好，每次碰到危难，总是能够逃脱，不然就是遇上朝廷大赦。
As luck would have it, however, he always contrived to extricate himself from trouble or to be pardoned by an amnesty.

及解年长，更折节为俭,以德报怨，厚施而薄望。
到郭解长大成人时，一下子变成了一个谨慎守法的人。他用恩德回报别人的仇怨，他给别人的多而希望取得的少。
As Guo Xie grew older he became more humble and repaid evil with kindness, giving much and asking little in return.

然其自喜为侠益甚。

He grew fonder than ever of noble deeds of daring.

既已振人之命，不矜其功，其阴贼著于心，卒发于睚眦如故云。
他救完了人家的命，从不夸耀自己的功劳。他把残忍深藏在心底，说不定什么时候会因一点小事而突然爆发。

解姊子负解之势，与人饮，使之嚼。非其任，强必灌之。
郭解姐姐的儿子倚仗郭解的势力，劝人喝酒，人家喝不了，他非灌人家。
Guo Xie's elder sister had a son who took advantage of his uncle's influence. One day while drinking, this lad insisted that his companion should drain his cup, and although the other declared himself unable to do so he forced the wine down his throat.

人怒，拔刀刺杀解姊子，亡去。
逼得人急了，动手杀了郭解的外甥，而后逃走了。
In a fury the man drew his dagger and stabbed the boy to death, after which he fled.

解姊怒曰：“以翁伯之义,人杀吾子，贼不得。”
郭解的姐姐对郭解说：“凭你这么大的名气，有人杀了我的儿子，凶手竟然抓不到?”

弃其尸于道，弗葬，欲以辱解。

And the latter, knowing that he could not escape, came to Guo Xie of his own accord and told him what had happened.

解曰：“公杀之固当，吾儿不直。”
郭解说：“你杀的对，是我们的孩子没有道理。”
"You were right to kill him," said Guo Xie. "The boy was in the wrong."

遂去其贼，罪其姊子，乃收而葬之。
于是放走了凶手，归罪于自己的外甥，把他的尸体收起来埋葬了。

One day, however, a man squatted insolently by the roadside to stare at him, and Guo Xie sent to inquire this stranger's name.

客欲杀之。
门下的人想要杀他。
His followers wanted to kill the man.

解曰：“居邑屋至不见敬,是吾德不修也，彼何罪!”
郭解说：“同住在一个县城而不受人敬重，是我的德行没有修好，他有什么罪!”
but Guo Xie said, "If someone in my own district treats me rudely, it must mean that I am lacking in virtue. Why do you blame him?"

乃阴属尉史曰:“是人，吾所急也,至践更时脱之。”
于是暗中告诉县尉说：“那个人是我所关心的，等轮到该他出徭役时请免掉他。”
And he secretly told the local officers, "I have a high regard for this man. When his turn comes for conscription, let him off."

每至践更，数过，吏弗求。

客乃见郭解。解夜见仇家，仇家曲听解。
有人就去拜见郭解。郭解连夜去见仇家，仇家勉强听从了郭解的调解。
When the matter was taken to Guo Xie he went by night to see the two enemies, and they brought themselves to accept his mediation.

解乃谓仇家曰：“吾闻雒阳诸公在此间，多不听者。今子幸而听解，解奈何乃从他县夺人邑中贤大夫权乎!”
郭解对仇家说：“我听说洛阳各位贤士在此调解，你们大多不听从。现在你们有幸听从我的调解，我怎能从别的县来侵夺人家城中贤士大夫的调解权力呢！”
"I hear that many citizens of Luoyang have interceded with you, yet you did not listen to them," said Guo Xie. "I am glad that you are willing to take my advice. But it is not right for a stranger from another district to outshine your own worthies and detract from their prestige.”

乃夜去，不使人知，曰：“且无用，待我去，令雒阳豪居其间，乃听之。”
于是（郭解）连夜离开，不让人知道，说：“暂时先不要按我的话做，等我离开后，让洛阳的贤豪从中调解，那时你们再听从。”
He left under cover of darkness so that no one might know of his visit. "Go ahead without me," he told the two men. “Once I have gone and the chief citizens of Luoyang come again to reason with you, do as they say.”

解执恭敬，出未尝有骑，不敢乘车入其县廷。
郭解待人恭敬，出门从未骑马，更不敢乘车进入本县的官署。

到邻近的郡国，为别人办事，事情能解决的，就解决；不能解决的，也设法让每个人都满意，之后才敢吃饭喝酒。
When he went to neighbouring districts at his friends' request, if he could solve their problems, well and good; if not, he made a point of satisfying them in different ways before tasting food and wine.

诸公以故严重之,争为用。
大家因此越发敬重他，争相为他效力。
Thus he was highly respected and many people were only too eager to serve him.

到了迁徙富豪到茂陵的时候，郭解家境贫穷，财产不够迁徙的标准，但官吏害怕（上面怪罪），不敢不迁徙他。

卫将军为言:“郭解家贫不中徙。”

General Wei Qing spoke up for him, saying that he was a poor man and should not be moved.

上曰：“布衣权至使将军为言，此其家不贫。”
皇上说：“一个平民的权势竟能让将军为他求情，这说明他家里并不贫穷。”
But the emperor retorted, "If a private citizen is influential enough to prevail on the grand marshal to speak for him, he cannot be very poor!”

解家遂徙。诸公送者出千余万。
郭解家最终还是被迁徙了。为他送行的人出资达一千多万。

临晋籍少公素不知解，解冒，因求出关。
临晋的籍少公一向不认识郭解，郭解冒名（求见），趁机请求出关。
Since Ji Shaogong, the officer at Linjin, did not know him and Guo Xie had assumed a false name, he was able to escape through the Pass.

籍少公已出解，解转入太原，所过辄告主人家。
籍少公放走郭解后，郭解辗转到了太原，所经过的地方，总会把自己的行踪告诉留宿他的人家。

吏逐之，迹至籍少公。少公自杀，口绝。
官吏追捕郭解，追踪线索到了籍少公那里。籍少公自杀，（追查的）口供断绝。
the authorities were able to trace him as far as Ji Shaogong; but as the latter had committed suicide the trail was lost.

久之，乃得解。穷治所犯，为解所杀，皆在赦前。
过了很久，才抓到郭解。（官吏）彻底追查他的罪行，发现被郭解所杀的人，都在（朝廷）大赦之前。
it was some time before Guo Xie was captured. During Guo Xie's trial, it was found that he had committed no murders since the last amnesty.

轵有儒生侍使者坐，客誉郭解，生曰：“郭解专以奸犯公法，何谓贤！”
轵县有个儒生陪侍前来办案的使者坐着，有门客称赞郭解，这个儒生说：“郭解专门凭借奸诈触犯国法，怎么能说贤能呢！”
A Confucian scholar from Zhi was sitting with the officers during the investigation. When one of Guo Xie's admirers praised him, this scholar said, “Guo Xie has done nothing but break the law and commit crimes. What good can there be in such a man?”

解客闻，杀此生，断其舌。
郭解的门客听说后，杀了这个儒生，并割掉了他的舌头。
One of Guo's followers killed this scholar and cut out his tongue.

吏以此责解，解实不知杀者。杀者亦竟绝，莫知为谁。
官吏因此责问郭解，郭解确实不知道杀人者是谁。杀人者也最终销声匿迹，没人知道是谁。
The officers laid the blame for this on Guo Xie, although in fact he did not know the murderer, who was never found.

吏奏解无罪。御史大夫公孙弘议曰：“解布衣为任侠行权，以睚眦杀人，解虽弗知，此罪甚于解杀之。当大逆无道。”
官吏上奏说郭解无罪。御史大夫公孙弘议论说：“郭解作为平民行侠弄权，因为一点小事就杀人，郭解即使不知道（这件事），这个罪过也比他自己杀人还重。应当判定为大逆无道。”
The officers reported that Guo Xie was not guilty of the charges against him. Gongsun Hong the chief counsellor protested, “Guo Xie is a common citizen who sets himself up as the arbiter of justice and kills men for the most trivial offences. The fact that he does not know the murderer makes the case more serious than if he had killed the scholar himself. He is guilty of high treason."

遂族郭解翁伯。
于是就把郭解（字翁伯）全族诛杀了。
So Guo Xie and his clan were put to death.

自是之后，为侠者极众，敖而无足数者。
从此以后，行侠的人非常多，但都傲慢无礼，不值得一提。
There have since been many gallant citizens, too arrogant in their behaviour to be worth mentioning.

然关中长安樊仲子，槐里赵王孙，长陵高公子，西河郭公仲，太原卤公孺，临淮兒长卿，东阳田君孺，虽为侠而逡逡有退让君子之风。
但关中长安的樊仲子、槐里的赵王孙、长陵的高公子、西河的郭公仲、太原的卤公孺、临淮的兒长卿、东阳的田君孺，虽然行侠，却谦逊恭谨，有君子退让的风度。
But there was Fan Zhongzi of Chang'an, Zhao Wangsun of Huaili, Gao Gongzi of Changling, Guo Gongzhong of Xihe, Lu Gongru of Taiyuan, Ni Changqing of Linhuai and Tian Junru of Dongyang. Although these men acted in a daring way, they were courteous and unassuming gentlemen.

至若北道姚氏，西道诸杜，南道仇景，东道赵他、羽公子，南阳赵调之徒，此盗跖居民间者耳，曷足道哉！
至于北方道路上的姚氏、西方道路上的各杜姓（游侠）、南方道路上的仇景、东方道路上的赵他和羽公子、南阳的赵调这类人，不过是些藏在民间的盗跖罢了，哪里值得一提呢！
The Yao family in the north, the Du family in the west, Qiu Jing in the south, Zao Tayu or Zhao Gongzi in the east, and Zhao Tiao in Nanyang were virtually brigands quite beneath our notice.

此乃乡者朱家之羞也。
这些人是过去朱家那样的（贤侠）所感到羞耻的。
... and utterly unfit to be compared with Zhu Jia of earlier times.

太史公曰：吾视郭解，状貌不及中人，言语不足采者。
太史公说：我看郭解，相貌赶不上普通人，言谈也没什么可取之处。
The Grand Historian comments: When I saw Guo Xie, his appearance was in no way striking, neither was his conversation memorable.

然天下无贤与不肖，知与不知，皆慕其声，言侠者皆引以为名。
但天下无论贤能还是无能的人，认识还是不认识他的人，都仰慕他的名声，谈论游侠的人都把他当作榜样来标榜自己。
Yet everybody in the empire, high or low, whether he knew him or not, admires him and cites him as an example of gallant daring.

谚曰：“人貌荣名，岂有既乎！”於戏，惜哉！
俗话说：“人的容貌和荣誉名声，难道有穷尽吗！”唉，太可惜了！
"Fame sheds lustre on beauty," says the proverb. "It is fame that endures.” Alas, that he came to such an end!
